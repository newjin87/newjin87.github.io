        "content": "A little more than three years ago, Microsoft helped kick off the artificial intelligence revolution after the company invested billions into ChatGPT developer OpenAI. Since then, the Windows maker has swiftly integrated AI throughout its massive ecosystem -- from cloud computing to data analytics, software coding, and more.\n\nDespite Microsoft being one of the most influential leaders of the AI boom, investors have been punishing its stock as of late -- with shares plummeting 16% since the company reported earnings on Jan. 28. Let's dive into the factors plaguing Microsoft stock right now and assess if the ongoing sell-off is actually an opportunity for smart investors to buy the dip.\n\nOne of the primary use cases for AI is how hyper-scalers integrate the technology into their cloud platforms. While Amazon Web Services holds the largest market share among major cloud services providers, Microsoft Azure is right behind it.\n\nWith each passing earnings report, investors dial in on Azure's growth relative to its peers. For the quarter ended Dec. 31, Azure's revenue increased 39% year over year. By comparison, AWS grew by 24% and Google Cloud Platform rose 48%. While GCP is accelerating at a much faster pace than Azure and AWS, it's also a far smaller business.\n\nWith this in mind, I don't think concerns over Azure's growth are the only culprit behind Microsoft's sell-off. Rather, the company's rising infrastructure costs are beginning to make investors nervous.\n\nDuring the earnings call, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood said she thinks investors are making a \"direct correlation\" between Microsoft's capital expenditures and Azure's revenue. This is a subtle way of saying management realizes that investors are questioning the return on investment around Microsoft's accelerating AI infrastructure buildouts.\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, Microsoft stock hasn't been this cheap since the dawn of the AI revolution. The company's price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 25 is hovering near its lowest levels in roughly three years.\n\nOn top of that, the consensus price target for Microsoft stock among sell-side analysts is $596 -- implying 48% upside from current levels. To me, this suggests that Wall Street remains bullish on Microsoft's AI road map and is confident in management's ability to allocate capital strategically.\n\nGiven its attractive valuation profile and upside potential, buying Microsoft stock hand over fist might seem like a no-brainer. That said, there is still some execution risk when it comes to the company's infrastructure build-outs and their ability to bear fruit and impact Azure, as well as other pockets of Microsoft's ecosystem, in an accretive way.\n\nFor this reason, I would cautiously buy the dip in Microsoft stock right now but wouldn't bet the farm. I think the sell-off is overblown and taking advantage of the depressed price action could prove to be a savvy choice in the long run.\n\nAdam Spatacco has positions in Amazon and Microsoft.

        "content": "Walmart (NYSE: WMT), one of the top-performing blue-chip stocks of 2026, is set to release its next quarterly earnings report on February 19. Investors are closely monitoring whether Walmart stock remains a solid buy ahead of the event. The retail giant has recently achieved impressive growth, making it a standout in a challenging market.\n\nWalmart stock has surged 20.18% in 2026, outpacing both the S&P 500 and Dow Jones indices. In contrast, the broader market has struggled, with the S&P 500 declining by 0.33% and the Dow Jones rising by just 2.31%. This strong performance is raising questions about whether the stock can continue to climb or if a pullback is imminent.\n\nThe retailer’s market capitalization recently crossed $1 trillion, making it the first retailer to reach this milestone. Despite its success, there are concerns about the stock’s high valuation, especially ahead of its upcoming earnings report. A slight miss in earnings could trigger a correction, similar to what occurred with Microsoft’s stock after its latest report.\n\nWall Street remains largely positive on Walmart stock, with an average rating of ‘Strong Buy.’ However, analysts’ 12-month price targets suggest that the stock may see only modest growth. Walmart stock is expected to retrace 0.63%, with a target price of $133.04 in the next year.\n\nSeveral analysts have raised concerns about potential pullbacks despite the positive outlook. Bernstein’s Zhihan Ma recently maintained a ‘Buy’ rating but forecasted a drop to $129. Similarly, Citi’s most bullish forecast of $147 suggests just a 9.79% increase from current levels. These predictions indicate that even optimistic estimates expect limited upside for the stock in the near term.\n\nAhead of its earnings report, Walmart’s strong performance in recent quarters offers some reassurance. The company has exceeded earnings per share (EPS) forecasts in three of the last four quarters, increasing the likelihood of another beat. Walmart’s diversified business model, which includes e-commerce and technology, positions it well in both favorable and unfavorable economic conditions.\n\nEven if the economy faces a downturn, Walmart’s reputation for offering ‘great value’ prices could drive continued consumer demand. This defensive nature of Walmart’s business model has contributed to its strong performance, making it a relatively safe investment in uncertain times.\n\nDiscover top-performing stocks in AI, Crypto, and Technology with expert analysis.\n\nMaxwell is a crypto-economic analyst and blockchain enthusiast, passionate about helping people understand the potential of decentralized technology.
