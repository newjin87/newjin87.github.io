        "content": "Microsoft (MSFT) shares dropped below $400 despite its largest earnings beat ever. Investors demand proof AI spending creates sustainable margins.\n\nMicrosoft stock fell 17.46% this year despite 47% operating margins and 26% cloud revenue growth.\n\nGoogle declined only 1.2% this year by integrating AI into existing products. NVIDIA stayed flat by selling infrastructure without promising future returns.\n\nSending You to Google News in 3\n\nOne of the biggest names in tech, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT | MSFT Price Prediction) shares have plunged below $400 despite delivering the largest earnings beat in company history, as investors question whether the company’s massive AI infrastructure spending will ever translate into profitable product adoption. The stock has plunged nearly a fifth this year as investors rotate away from AI infrastructure plays toward companies demonstrating actual product monetization. Retail investor sentiment on Reddit remains neutral at 51.88, reflecting this confusion.\n\nThe disconnect highlights Wall Street’s AI monetization anxiety as Microsoft posted record operating margins above 47% and grew cloud revenue by double digits (26% year-over-year), yet shares have collapsed from their peak as Wall Street demands proof that massive AI spending translates to sustainable margins rather than just revenue growth. The market isn’t questioning Microsoft’s operational excellence, it’s demanding evidence that AI spending generates sustainable returns, not just top-line growth. Despite returning billions to shareholders and posting record quarterly revenue, the market is punishing Microsoft for failing to demonstrate that AI infrastructure spending will generate sustainable returns.\n\nThe most-engaged post on r/stocks captured the tension perfectly, with 407 upvotes and 386 comments. The author of this highly-engaged Reddit post argued Microsoft’s 1.5 billion+ Windows devices give Copilot an unmatched distribution advantage, and that current product weaknesses mirror early criticism of Google’s Bard, which preceded Google’s stock doubling.\n\nThe post author wrote: “Microsoft has 1.5 billion+ Windows devices, and Copilot is integrated into all of them. This gives Microsoft an unmatched distribution advantage that no other AI company can replicate.” They further argued that current skepticism mirrors the early criticism of Google’s Bard, noting that “people said the same things about Bard being inferior to ChatGPT, yet Google’s stock doubled after they demonstrated AI integration across their product suite.”\n\nAnother popular discussion examined why Microsoft fell after beating earnings, highlighting the disconnect between operational performance and market reaction.\n\nBut Wall Street isn’t buying it. The core concerns driving the selloff center on the gap between AI infrastructure investment and actual product monetization, with investors demanding concrete proof that spending translates to sustainable margins.\n\nThe disconnect between analyst optimism and market pricing reveals Wall Street’s demand for concrete evidence of AI monetization. Microsoft trades at 25x trailing earnings with analysts projecting significant upside, yet the stock trades near bear-case levels as investors price in substantial AI monetization risk that 33 “Strong Buy” analysts collectively reject. The market is punishing Microsoft not for operational failures but for failing to demonstrate that billions in AI infrastructure spending will generate sustainable margin expansion rather than just revenue growth.\n\nThe contrast with other tech giants reveals Microsoft’s unique challenge. Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has declined just 1.2% year-to-date by integrating AI into existing profitable products, whereas NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) remains essentially flat for 2026 by selling the underlying infrastructure rather than promising future monetization. Microsoft is being punished specifically for the gap between AI infrastructure spending and product adoption. Investors want proof that the company’s “AI business is larger than some of our biggest franchises” claim translates to sustainable margins, not just revenue.\n\nOur top personal finance-related articles today.

        "content": "ANGELA WEISS / AFP via Getty Images\n\nStocks rose on Wednesday, but pared their gains as investors questioned the outlook for interest rates in light of the minutes of January's Federal Reserve meeting.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.8% on Wednesday, while the benchmark S&P 500 advanced 0.6% and the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.3%. All three major indexes eked out tiny gains on Tuesday in a volatile session driven by rising and ebbing tech jitters.\n\nThe minutes of the Federal Reserve's last meeting revealed starkly diverging views among policymakers on the appropriate path of monetary policy. Some officials want to leave the door open for the Fed to raise rates if inflation remains sticky, while others are eager to continue cutting, according to the minutes released Wednesday.\n\nThe majority of officials voted in late January to leave interest rates unchanged for the first time since July. The odds of more cuts in the next few months dwindled last week following surprisingly rosy inflation and jobs reports. The December Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, is set to be released on Friday morning.\n\nTech stocks found their footing Wednesday. Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) rose 1.6% after social media giant Meta (META) announced a new deal to buy millions of its chips. Several of Wall Street's favorite AI \"pick and shovel\" stocks rose, including Micron (MU) and Western Digital (WDC). Meta shares rose 0.6%.\n\nThe remainder of the Magnificent Seven closed in the green. Shares of Amazon (AMZN) rose nearly 2% despite Berkshire Hathaway reporting on Tuesday it had sold nearly all of its stake in the e-commerce giant. Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) posted marginal gains.\n\nOn the earnings front, shares of Palo Alto Networks (PANW) slid 7% after its earnings guidance came up short of expectations. The stocks of chip firms Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) and Analog Devices (ADI) rose 8% and 3%, respectively, after each topped estimates on the top and bottom lines.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield, which impacts interest rates on a variety of consumer loans including mortgages, was recently 4.08%, up from 4.06% at Tuesday's close.\n\nWest Texas Intermediate futures, the U.S. crude oil benchmark, rose about 4.5% to $65.10 a barrel after Vice President JD Vance cast doubt on the progress of diplomatic negotiations between the U.S. and Iran. Gold and silver futures rebounded from their slump yesterday. Gold climbed 1.8% to $4,995 an ounce, while silver rose 4.9% to $77.10 an ounce.\n\nBitcoin traded around $66,300 in the late afternoon, down from its overnight highs above $68,000. The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the value of the greenback against a basket of currencies, ticked up 0.6% to 97.70.\n\nHoops or Hockey? Investors Might Get to Own Shares of the Knicks and Rangers\n\nIf you've always wanted to own a piece of a pro basketball team, this deal might be a slam dunk. (If you prefer ice hockey, insert your favorite metaphor here.)\n\nMadison Square Garden Sports (MSGS), which owns the NBA's New York Knicks and NHL's New York Rangers, said its board would explore a spinoff that would create publicly traded companies for each team. (The stadium itself is owned by Madison Square Garden Entertainment (MSGE), which was created by the 2020 separation of the teams from the facility.)\n\n\"We believe this proposed transaction would provide each company with enhanced strategic flexibility, its own defined business focus, and clear characteristics for investors,\" MSGS CEO Jim Dolan said.\n\nThe company's statement said no timetable had been set for a deal, and that it was not certain one would happen. League approval would be required, the company said.\n\nThe deal would offer investors an opportunity to do something comparatively rare: put their money where their rooting mouths are.\n\nMost sports teams are privately owned, and none of the organizations in the top U.S. leagues—the NBA and NHL, but also the NFL, Major League Baseball and MLS—are traded as single stocks. Some teams are owned by larger conglomerates; the Green Bay Packers do offer public ownership, though through a somewhat unconventional arrangement.\n\nThe Knicks are faring better than the Rangers so far in their respective seasons, but Madison Square Garden Sports stock is hot. The shares are up substantially today on the news, bringing their rise to roughly 30% this year—and they've added almost three-quarters of their value over the past five years.\n\nIn 2025, the Knicks were ranked among the top 10 most valuable sports franchises worldwide at some $9.5 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nCiti analysts on Wednesday said they value the stock at $337, about 15% above yesterday's close; the Knicks, they said, accounted for $226 of that. \"We like the proposed spin-off and see it as a viable step to potentially unlock value,\" they wrote.\n\nHere's How Much Traders Expect Carvana Stock To Move After Earnings on Wedneday\n\nCarvana is set to report earnings after the market closes today, with traders expecting a big move in the online used car dealer's stock following the results.\n\nBased on recent options pricing, traders expect Carvana's (CVNA) stock could swing up to 13.5% in either direction by the end of the week. A move of that magnitude from Tuesday's close near $351 would lift Carvana shares to about $398. The low end of the range would see the stock slip below $304, its lowest point since last November.\n\nCarvana has had a difficult start to 2026, as a short-seller report released last month sent the stock tumbling from its record highs. Carvana stock had rallied to end 2025 as it joined the S&P 500 and analysts laid out bullish visions for the company.\n\nJPMorgan analysts said the basis of the short-seller report appeared to include an incorrect reading of some of Carvana's finances by the authors, leading to a \"significant misrepresentation of facts.\" The analysts recently lifted their price target for Carvana to $510 from $490, and said they expect the company to report strong sales growth for the fourth quarter that could carry through to the first quarter of 2026.\n\nCarvana is projected to report a 48% year-over-year jump in revenue to $5.25 billion, while earnings per share are seen rising to $1.01 from 56 cents the same time a year ago.\n\nAnalysts have stayed bullish on Carvana stock despite the recent slump, with 12 of the 13 analysts with current ratings tracked by Visible Alpha calling the company a \"buy,\" with just one \"hold\" rating. Their mean target of $500 would suggest 40% upside from Tuesday's close.\n\nThe shares, which were up about 2% in recent trading ahead of the company's earnings report, have lost about 15% since the start of the year.\n\nNvidia Sold Its Stakes in These Firms. The Stocks Are Sliding.\n\nNvidia is backing out of some of its bets.\n\nShares of three AI-focused firms fell Wednesday following the news that Nvidia (NVDA) sold its stakes in the companies in the fourth quarter. Data center service provider Applied Digital (APLD) dropped nearly 10%, while drug developer Recursion Pharmaceuticals (RXRX) plunged 14% and driverless tech company WeRide (WRD) slipped close to 4%, before paring their losses later in the session.\n\nA regulatory filing revealed Nvidia's sales of the companies' shares but didn't specify the company's reasoning. Nvidia declined to comment on the changes to its portfolio.\n\nNvidia's stock climbed about 2%, bringing it back into positive territory for 2026 after a rough start to the year marked by lingering worries about an AI bubble. Read Investopedia's full daily markets roundup here.\n\nNvidia's latest 13F filing also revealed it dropped its shares of Arm (ARM), the chip designer and long-term partner it tried to acquire in 2020. Shares of Arm were up about 1% recently, building on gains earlier this month after the company posted better-than-expected earnings.\n\nNvidia added positions in struggling rival Intel (INTC), chip design software maker Synopsys (SNPS), and Finnish telecom Nokia (NOK). Synopsys shares climbed about 5% in recent trading, while Nokia shares added 1.5%. Intel shares were little changed.\n\nWhile the investment in Intel shouldn't come as a surprise, after Nvidia's September announcement of a multibillion-dollar investment and partnership, rumors have continued to swirl lately about deepening ties and a possible foundry deal in the works.\n\nNvidia kept its holdings in AI cloud infrastructure providers CoreWeave (CRWV) and Nebius Group (NBIS) unchanged. CoreWeave and Nebius shares climbed about 5% and 4%, respectively.\n\nPalo Alto Networks' Deals Are Dragging on Its Profit Outlook. The Stock Is Falling\n\nPalo Alto Networks' string of recent deals is hurting its profit outlook, weighing on its stock.\n\nShares of Palo Alto Networks (PANW) were down 6% to about $153 in recent trading after the cybersecurity provider's full-year outlook disappointed. It was the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 and Dow on a day when broader markets gained.\n\nPalo Alto Networks said late Tuesday that it now expects adjusted earnings per share of $3.65 to $3.70 for the full fiscal year, down from its previous range of $3.80 to $3.90. The company is grappling with higher integration costs tied to its recent acquisitions, including its $25 billion purchase of CyberArk.\n\nMorgan Stanley analysts trimmed their price target for Palo Alto Networks stock to $223 from $245 following the results. However, they maintained an \"overweight\" rating and called its post-earnings drop \"overdone,\" citing the company's \"compelling argument for AI as a tailwind.\"\n\nMeanwhile, analysts at Wedbush stood by their \"outperform rating\" and $225 target Wednesday, calling Palo Alto Networks \"one of our favorite cyber names to own in 2026.\" Though ratings are still in flux, most analysts tracked by Visible Alpha have stood by their bullish ratings for the stock.\n\nPalo Alto Networks reported adjusted earnings per shares of $1.03 on a 15% year-over-year jump in revenue to $2.59 billion for its fiscal second quarter. Both figures came in above analysts' estimates compiled by Visible Alpha.\n\nWith Wednesday's slide, Palo Alto Networks shares have lost about 16% of their value since the start of the year.\n\nThe S&P 500 Is Flat For the Year, But There Are Big Moves Below the Surface\n\nWall Street is behaving a lot like Capitol Hill so far this year.\n\nAs of Tuesday’s close, the S&P 500 was down 0.03% since the start of the year. That's about as unexceptional as it gets, but it belies a lot of churn below the surface.\n\nAccording to a recent analysis by Bespoke Investment Group, 117 stocks in the S&P 500 have gained or lost more than 20% so far this year. Meanwhile, just 94 of the index’s components are up or down less than 5%.\n\nAs in Washington, D.C., “we’ve seen an increase in concentration at the extremes with nothing to show for it,” wrote Bespoke’s analysts in a note on Wednesday.\n\nThe massive disparity in performance is pronounced in the tech sector, where more than 40% of stocks are either up or down more than 20% this year. Seventeen stocks are sharply higher, including AI “pick and shovel” plays like memory device makers Sandisk (SNDK) and Western Digital (WDC), up 150% and 70%, respectively. On the flip side are the dozen (mostly software) stocks that have been battered by concerns about AI disruption. They include Intuit (INTU) and ServiceNow (NOW), down a respective 40% and 30%.\n\nExtreme moves are causing the capitalization-weighted S&P 500 to trail the equal-weight index by about 5.5 percentage points, the cap-weighted index’s worst relative performance since 1992, according to Bespoke.\n\nWedbush Sees Big Gains for These Cybersecurity Stocks. Here's Why\n\nIt's been a rough start to the year for the software sector, but one group of experts said they see big gains ahead for some beaten-down cybersecurity stocks.\n\nAs the use of AI spreads, companies could face growing risks that drive up demand for cybersecurity services, according to analysts at Wedbush, who named three stocks they see as likely \"winners\" in a note Tuesday.\n\nOne of them is CrowdStrike (CRWD), which Wedbush said remains a \"gold standard of cybersecurity\" despite the stock's recent selloff. The shares are down about 13% year-to-date, with Wedbush's $600 price target suggesting nearly 45% upside from Wednesday's level around $420.\n\nWedbush also identified ZScaler (ZS) as a \"premier name to own in the cyber space,\" with a strong product pipeline and AI strategy. The analysts said they see the stock roughly doubling to $350 in the next 12 months.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW), which reported disappointing earnings after the closing bell Tuesday, rounded out Wedbush's trio. The analysts said the company, which has sought to expand its offerings with several acquisitions recently, has seen its value proposition improve as companies look to consolidate vendors. Wedbush's price target at $225 is about 45% above the stock's recent level.\n\nInvestors could also get more insights when ZScaler reports next week on Feb. 26, with CrowdStrike scheduled to release its latest quarterly results on March 3.\n\nModerna Stocks Rises After FDA Reverses Course on New Flu Vaccine Review\n\nModerna (MRNA) stock rose 6% on Wednesday after the company said the Food and Drug Administration agreed to review its application for a new flu shot that regulators had previously refused to consider.\n\nModerna on Wednesday said that, after meeting with the FDA, it had submitted an amended application for its new mRNA influenza vaccine. Federal drug regulators last week surprised investors when they refused to review Moderna’s application. Moderna is seeking full approval for adults 50 to 64, and accelerated approval for adults over 65. The review is expected to be complete by Aug. 5.\n\n“We appreciate the FDA's engagement in a constructive Type A meeting and its agreement to advance our application for review,\" said CEO Stéphane Bancel in a press release.\n\nWith Wednesday’s gains, Moderna shares have risen nearly 60% since the start of the year. The stock got a boost last month after the release of encouraging data from a cancer clinical trial.\n\nIn Buffett's Last Quarter as CEO, Berkshire Slashed Amazon Stake and Sold More Apple\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK.A)(BRK.B), the conglomerate formerly led by famed investor Warren Buffett, reduced its holdings in tech giants Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) in the final quarter of 2025, according to a regulatory filing released Tuesday.\n\nBerkshire sold about 10.3 million shares of Apple, about 4% of the firm’s stake in the iPhone maker. Berkshire has been steadily trimming its stake in Apple—its largest position—since late 2023, though the pace of its sales has slowed. Berkshire’s stake, once worth about $175 billion, totaled about $60 billion as of Tuesday’s close. Shares were down about 0.3% in early trading Wednesday.\n\nBerkshire made a bigger cut to its Amazon holdings, selling 7.7 million shares, or more than 75% of its stake in the e-commerce giant. The holdings, worth about $2.1 billion at the end of the third quarter, were valued at about $457 million as of Tuesday. Amazon stock rose 1.5% Wednesday morning.\n\nTuesday's filing is the last Berkshire portfolio update overlapping with Warren Buffett's tenure as chief executive. Buffett, who took over Berkshire in 1965 and built it into an insurance and investment behemoth worth more than $1 trillion, officially handed the reins over to current CEO Greg Abel when he retired at the end of last year.\n\nApple stock rose nearly 7% in the fourth quarter. Apple, unlike Big Tech peers such as Meta (META) and Alphabet (GOOG), is not spending hand over fist on AI infrastructure, and that became a tailwind for the stock when the AI rally wavered last quarter. Amazon shares rose 5% in the same period.\n\nFutures Point To Higher Open as Tech Stocks Find Footing\n\nFutures contracts connected to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 0.3% in premarket trading on Wednesday.\n\nNasdaq 100 contracts gained 0.5%.\n\nBeSpoke Investment Group. “A Flat Market with Extreme Single-Stock Moves.”\n\nModerna. “Moderna Announces the U.S. Food and Drug Administration will Initiate the Review of Its Investigational Seasonal Influenza Vaccine Submission.”"

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) stock has gained about 32% over the past year, at the time of writing, Tuesday afternoon, Feb. 17, according to Yahoo Finance. Meanwhile, the SPDR S&P 500 index (SPY) is up about 11% in the same period.\n\nIt is impressive that Nvidia has outpaced the S&P 500 by more than 20%, but even more so when we look at other members of the Magnificent 7:\n\nMeta is 13% down in the same period.\n\nApple is only up a little more than 7%.\n\nThe only exception, a Mag 7 member that fared better than Nvidia, is Google, which is 62% up in the same period.\n\nHyperscalers have announced huge capital expenditures (capex) for this year. I’ve covered Amazon earnings and capex outlook here, and Meta’s earnings and capex outlook here. Nvidia will release its Q4 earnings on February 25.\n\nBank of America analyst Vivek Arya and his team updated their cloud capex outlook, AI data center total addressable market estimates, and revised forecast for Nvidia ahead of earnings.\n\nTo refresh your memory on how Nvidia Q3 earnings looked, read my article “Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and BofA drop verdicts on Nvidia earnings.”\n\nRevenue is expected to be $65.0 billion, plus or minus 2%.\n\nGAAP gross margins are expected to be 74.8% plus or minus 0.5%.\n\nGAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $6.7 billion.\n\nArya and his team believe that capital expenditures for 2026 and 2027 will reach $748 billion and $869 billion, respectively. These numbers represent year-over-year growth of 56% and 16%, respectively.\n\nGiven this exceptionally strong 2026 cloud capex outlook, the team has now updated its 2030 AI data center systems total addressable market estimate to approximately $1.4 trillion, up from the prior estimate of $1.2 trillion.\n\nRelated: BofA revamps Applied Materials stock price target after CEO message\n\nAnalysts expect the overall data center systems total addressable market to accelerate in 2026, growing by 64% YoY, with AI systems growing even faster at approximately 100% YoY, driven by new AI accelerator deployments.\n\nThe team expects that AI accelerator vendors will generally pass on their rising HBM/DDR costs to customers, maintaining margins as scale and system sales increase.\n\nAnalysts said that even after excluding Google due to its reliance on its own TPUs, 2026 cloud capex is expected to increase approximately 45% YoY, to $180 billion.\n\nAssuming two-thirds of this spending will go toward servers, analysts estimate an increase of approximately $120 billion in potential compute chip sales this year, which is in line with their new Nvidia outlook of a $110 billion increase in data center compute sales.\n\nThe team added that the remaining $10 billion to $20 billion of sales will be split across AMD and non-TPU ASICs.\n\nRelated: History of Nvidia: Company timeline and facts\n\nAnalysts raised their sales estimates for Nvidia for fiscal years 2027, 2028, and 2029 by +7%/+2%/+2% to $342.33 billion/$422.75 billion/$496.3 billion, and raised EPS estimates by +8%/+3%/+3% to $8/$9.98/$11.94.\n\nThe team said that Google’s Gemini 3 Pro AI model, which was trained on Google’s custom TPU v7 Ironwood chips co-designed with Broadcom, may be the best AI model for now, but that it may soon change with Blackwell-trained LLMs.\n\nMorgan Stanley sets jaw-dropping Micron price target after event\n\nBank of America updates Palantir stock forecast after private meeting\n\nMorgan Stanley drops eye-popping Broadcom price target\n\nThey noted that all GPU-based models on the market today were trained on older-generation Nvidia Hopper GPUs, except Grok-4. However, even Grok-4 was mostly trained on older Nvidia chips, as xAI’s Collosus cluster, on which it was trained, consists of 150,000 H100, 50,000 H200, and only 30,000 Blackwell chips, B200/GB200.\n\nThe team expects any Blackwell-majority-trained LLMs to “rewrite the reasoning/coding benchmarks” once broadly available in early 2026.\n\nIn a research note shared with me, Arya reiterated a buy rating for Nvidia stock and the target price of $275, based on 28 multiple his estimate for price-to-earnings ratio excluding cash for calendar year 2027, which is within Nvidia’s historical forward year price-to-earnings range of 25 to 56.\n\nWeakness in consumer-driven gaming market\n\nCompetition with major public firms\n\nLarger-than-expected impact from restrictions on compute shipments to China\n\nLumpy and unpredictable sales in new enterprise, data center, and autosmarkets\n\nPotential for decelerating capital returns\n\nEnhanced government scrutiny of Nvidia’s dominant market position in AIchips\n\nRelated: Morgan Stanley flags $45B hidden cybersecurity opportunity\n\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Feb 17, 2026, where it first appeared in the Investing section.

In recent sessions, geopolitical tensions have shown signs of stabilising, reducing the urgency for defensive allocations into precious metals. As a result, some investors chose to book profits after the recent rally.\n\n· At the same time, the U.S. dollar strengthened, emerging as the dominant factor influencing price action. While January’s softer inflation data supported expectations of multiple rate cuts this year, strong nonfarm payroll numbers, steady private hiring, and continued economic growth have reduced the likelihood of an aggressive or immediate easing cycle. This shift in expectations has supported the dollar and created headwinds for gold and silver.\n\n· Geopolitical developments — including renewed U.S.–Iran nuclear discussions and ongoing Russia–Ukraine negotiations — continue to offer underlying support to gold’s safe-haven appeal.

A developing golden triangle formation on the charts highlights a compression phase, suggesting that a decisive breakout is approaching. The recent sell-off has flushed out leveraged participants, reflected in declining open interest and forced liquidations, while long-term holders continue to absorb supply, creating a fragile equilibrium. A sustained move below the $65,000 range would expose Bitcoin to a fast repricing toward the $60,000 liquidity pocket, driven by stop cascades rather than gradual selling. Conversely, if buyers reclaim control and push prices firmly above $70,000, it could trigger a renewed uptrend.

The largest crypto asset was trading between $67,200 and $67,800. This is indicative of a market that continues to sell into rallies rather than build momentum. Repeated failures near $70,000 over the past fortnight have reinforced that level as a firm near-term ceiling.\n\nOn the downside, $67,000 has emerged as the immediate line of defence. A decisive break below this zone would likely expose the $63,000-$60,000. This is where earlier demand had surfaced during the recent drawdown. Deeper on-chain reference points suggest that any sharper risk-off move could still gravitate toward the $55,000 region, which aligns closely with Bitcoin’s realised price. This is a widely tracked measure of the market’s aggregate cost basis.\n\nOn-chain data continues to frame the current phase as one of distribution rather than capitulation. Glassnode’s latest weekly on-chain assessment places Bitcoin well below its estimated ‘true market mean’ near $79,000. The realised price sits just under $55,000. This wide gap suggests persistent overhead supply. This means longer-term holders are largely inactive and shorter-term participants are driving price action within a broad $60,000-$72,000 corridor. Major analysts’ desks like CryptoQuant echoed this view and pointed to $55,000 as the next major stress-test level.\n\nInfosys unveiled its AI first value framework to help global enterprises unlock AI value at scale, harnessing the power of its generative and agentic AI suite, Infosys Topaz.\n\nShares traded 2% lower on the NSE at Rs 1,367.70\n\nCrude oil futures traded higher on Wednesday morning despite encouraging talks between the US and Iran regarding Iran’s nuclear programme.

The emphasis on access to compute infrastructure, data governance and responsible AI frameworks indicates a long-term capacity-building approach. At a time when global markets are navigating volatility driven by AI-led disruption and valuation recalibrations, clarity around execution pathways and private sector participation will be closely watched. The ongoing focus on innovation, human capital and institutional readiness is encouraging. We believe sustained follow-through will be key in translating technological ambition into productivity gains and long-term market confidence.” - Anooshka Soham Bathwal, Founder & CEO, Dhanvesttor\n\nGreenzo Energy India Ltd and Lord’s Mark Industries Limited have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to jointly develop green hydrogen and renewable energy projects across Uttar Pradesh.\n\nUnder the agreement, the companies will collaborate on developing approximately 60 MW of green hydrogen capacity, along with integrated solar rooftop projects coupled with battery energy storage systems, across key locations including Gorakhpur, Aligarh, Jhansi, and Lucknow.\n\nAs part of the partnership, Greenzo Energy will serve as the technology and EPC partner, responsible for engineering, procurement, construction, and commissioning of the projects. Lord’s Mark Industries will act as the project developer and investor, overseeing financing, regulatory approvals, project development, and commercial structuring.\n\nCapri Group, sponsor of alternative investment funds including Capri Stressed Assets Fund and Capri Special Situations Fund 1, said Sanjay Jain will be joining the Investment Manager to the Funds as Managing Partner, subject to requisite approvals from investors and the Securities and Exchange Board of India.\n\nJain will oversee the management and investment strategy of Capri Stressed Assets Fund and Capri Special Situations Fund 1. Capri Group is seeking regulatory approvals, to enable Mr Jain acquire 35% ownership in the Investment Manager & Sponsor of CSAF and CSSF1, reinforcing long-term alignment across the platform. Pending investors’ and SEBI’s approvals for reorganising the Investment Manager, Mr. Jain is currently serving as Managing Director & Chief Investment Officer.\n\nTrue North Private Equity via its alternative investment platform, the Credit Opportunities Fund I, has entered into definitive agreements to invest Rs 150 crore in ACN Healthcare RCM, a leading Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) solutions provider with operations in India and a global client base.\n\nACN Healthcare has demonstrated robust growth of over 68% CAGR over the last 3 years. The funds will be utilized towards growth and expansion of ACN Healthcare’s service portfolio, pursue strategic initiatives, and establish new delivery facilities, strengthening its ability to serve global healthcare providers.\n\nWodehouse Capital Advisors acted as the exclusive financial advisor to ACN Healthcare for the transaction and continues to advise the company on its ongoing fundraise and strategic initiatives.

The industry’s export basket is dominated by finished products such as footwear, leather goods, and garments, rather than raw hides, indicating significant domestic processing and value addition.\n\nCareEdge Ratings notes that India’s Union Budget 2026–27, along with the completion of the India–European Union (EU) Free Trade Agreement (FTA) as of January 27, 2026, and the recent cut in U.S. import tariffs, collectively create a positive policy environment for India’s leather industry. The Budget’s focus on streamlining import duties, reducing input costs, and simplifying procedures is likely to boost cost efficiency and operational performance. Additionally, the EU–FTA significantly improves market access and export competitiveness.\n\nGiven the industry’s existing focus on finished footwear, leather goods, and garments, the improved trade environment strengthens its ability to scale exports, stabilise demand, and deepen engagement with global buyers, enabling the Indian leather industry to capture a larger market share in the medium to long term. Together, these developments are expected to generate cost efficiencies, thereby improving profitability margins.\n\nWhatsApp Image 2026-02-18 at 7.26.23 AM.jpeg\n\nWhatsApp Image 2026-02-18 at 7.26.23 AM.jpeg\n\nThe short-term outlook is bullish for Astral. The 3 per cent rise this week has taken the share price well above the key resistance level of ₹1,593. The region around ₹1,590 will now act as a strong support. A fall below ₹1,590 is less likely, as new buyers can enter the market and limit the downside.\n\nBuy Astral shares at ₹1,646; target price ₹1,720 with strong support around ₹1,590 and bullish short-term outlook.\n\nPublished on  February 18, 2026\n\nComments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

        "content": "Fourth quarter earnings season is entering its final stretch.\n\nAs of Feb. 13, 74% of S&P 500 (^GSPC) companies had reported results, according to FactSet data, and blended earnings growth — meaning a combination of reported results from companies and projected profits from analysts — stood at 13.2%.\n\nIf that growth rate holds, it would represent the 10th consecutive quarter of annual earnings growth for the index and the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth.\n\nOn Wednesday, Carvana (CVNA) and DoorDash (DASH) took focus on the earnings docket. Carvana saw its shares sink after a profit miss and vague guidance, while DoorDash shares slid after its own mixed results.\n\nOver the balance of the week, investors will digest results from Walmart (WMT), the highlight of the week, as well as Deere & Co. (DE), Analog Devices (ADI), Booking Holdings (BKNG), and eBay (EBAY).\n\nCarvana stock fell as much 20% late Wednesday after the company reported fourth quarter profit that was light of estimates.\n\nYahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian reports:\n\nDoorDash (DASH) reported fourth quarter results that slightly missed Wall Street's expectations on the top and bottom lines, while total orders rose more than forecast.\n\nEarnings per share came in at $0.48, compared with the $0.55 the Street had forecast. But adjusted EBITDA reached $780 million in the quarter — up 38% compared to a year ago and almost $5 million above the Street's estimates.\n\nMeanwhile, revenue grew 28% year over year to $3.96 billion, a tick lower than the nearly $4 billion Wall Street predicted. Total orders, which means all orders through its marketplaces and commerce platform, also jumped 32% to 903 million in the quarter. That's more than the 888 million analysts had anticipated.\n\nMarketplace GOV — the total dollar value of transactions completed through the marketplace, including taxes, tips, and fees related to DashPass and its international platform Wolt+, clocked in at $29.7 billion compared to the expected $29.1 billion.\n\nThat was driven higher by growth in new customers and order rates among existing customers in the US restaurant category.\n\nIts stock fell as much as 8% following the results. Shares had lost about 20% this year through Wednesday's close.\n\nFor the first quarter of 2026, the company expects marketplace GOV to be in the range of $31.0 billion to $31.8 billion, above the Street's forecast of $30.75 billion.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $675 million to $775 million, which is below what the Street predicted of $800 million.\n\nWingstop (WING) shares jumped 14% on Wednesday after the popular restaurant chain reported fourth quarter earnings which beat analysts' expectations.\n\nAnalog Devices (ADI) stock rose 6% before the bell on Wednesday following the release of its second quarter earnings, which beat analysts' estimates. The company cited strong demand from its industrial and data ‌center customers as the artificial intelligence boom continues ​to drive semiconductor sales.\n\nGeneral Mills (GIS) stock fell 6% on Tuesday after the maker of Cheerios cereal lowered its fiscal 2026 sales forecast due to a more challenging consumer environment.\n\nTrading platform eToro's (ETOR) stock jumped 11% before the bell on Tuesday after beating estimates for fourth quarter profit.\n\nFourth quarter earnings season is entering the final stretch.\n\nIn the week ahead, the consumer will be in focus, with results from Walmart before the open on Thursday the headline event.\n\nThis report will be the first under its new CEO, John Furner, and the first since the company joined the trillion-dollar market cap club.\n\nOther notable companies reporting results include Booking Holdings (BKNG), DoorDash (DASH), and eBay (EBAY), all of which are set to report on Wednesday.\n\nData from FactSet published Friday noted some 74% of S&P 500 companies have reported results through the end of the week. Blended earnings growth for the quarter — meaning actual reported results and forecast earnings from analysts — has the pace of growth at 13.2% for the fourth quarter.\n\nThis puts the index on track to record a fifth straight quarter of double-digit profit gains.\n\nHere's the full calendar for the week ahead. And note that US markets are closed on Monday for Presidents' Day, but a few companies are still expected to report results.\n\nMonday: BHP Group (BHP), Sonoco Products Company (SON), Otter Tail Corporation (OTTR), ReNew Energy Global (RNW)\n\nTuesday: Medtronic (MDT), Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Constellation Energy (CEG), Cadence Design Systems (CDNS), Republic Services (RSG), Energy Transfer (ET), Vulcan Materials (VMC), EQT Corporation (EQT), Kenvue (KVUE), DTE Energy Company (DTE), FirstEnergy Corp. (FE), Devon Energy (DVN), Expand Energy (EXE), Leidos Holdings (LDOS), InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG), Genuine Parts Company (GPC), Sunoco (SUN)\n\nWednesday: Analog Devices (ADI), Booking Holdings (BKNG), Lloyds Banking Group (LYG), CRH (CRH), Moody's Corporation (MCO), Carvana (CVNA), DoorDash (DASH), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Kinross Gold Corporation (KGC), Garmin (GRMN), eBay (EBAY), Nutrien (NTR), Texas Pacific Land Corporation (TPL), Edison International (EIX), American Water Works Company (AWK), Verisk Analytics (VRSK), Pan American Silver Corp. (PAAS), Royal Gold (RGLD), Global Payments (GPN), Reliance (RS), Western Midstream Partners (WES), Host Hotels & Resorts (HST), Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL), Equinox Gold Corp. (EQX), Figma (FIG), HF Sinclair (DINO), Molson Coors (TAP), Wingstop (WING), Wyndham Hotels & Resorts (WH)\n\nThursday: Walmart (WMT), Rio Tinto (RIO), Deere & Company (DE), Newmont Corporation (NEM), The Southern Company (SO), Quanta Services (PWR), Targa Resources (TRGP), Comfort Systems USA (FIX), Consolidated Edison (ED), Cenovus Energy (CVE), Live Nation Entertainment (LYV), Copart (CPRT), Extra Space Storage (EXR), Teck Resources (TECK), CenterPoint Energy (CNP), Alliant Energy Corporation (LNT), Fidelity National Financial (FNF), Guardant Health (GH), DT Midstream (DTM), American Homes 4 Rent (AMH), Gaming and Leisure Properties (GLPI), Texas Roadhouse (TXRH)\n\nFriday: AngloGold Ashanti (AU), PPL Corporation (PPL), Lamar Advertising Company (LAMR), Sibanye Stillwater (SBSW), Hudbay Minerals (HBM), Portland General Electric Company (POR), Balchem Corporation (BCPC), Array Digital Infrastructure (AD), The Western Union Company (WU)\n\nCoinbase (COIN) posted a quarterly loss in the fourth quarter amid a sharp retrenchment in the crypto trade that saw bitcoin (BTC-USD) fall 45% over the past six months.\n\nThe crypto exchange reported a loss of $667 million, compared with a $1.3 billion profit in the same quarter a year ago. Revenue of $1.78 billion fell below expectations of $1.83 billion, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nTransaction revenue of $983 million also fell slightly below estimates. Coinbase said it has seen $420 million of transaction revenue in the first quarter through Feb. 10.\n\nFor the first quarter, Coinbase expects subscription and services revenue of $550 million to $630 million, compared to $710 million to $790 million in Q4.\n\nThe stock initially sold off but then reversed course and rose 3% in after-hours trading. Shares had fallen about 8% heading into the earnings report as Coinbase users experienced issues buying and selling on the exchange. \"Your funds are safe,\" a Coinbase customer support account posted on X.\n\nListen to the Q4 earnings call here at 5:30 p.m. ET.\n\nApplied Materials (AMAT) stock climbed 9% after the ⁠semiconductor equipment maker beat Wall Street expectations on the top and bottom lines.\n\nThe after-hours reaction to Applied Materials' results added to the strong run for the stock in 2026. Year to date, shares are up 27%.\n\nAirbnb (ABNB) stock gained 4% in extended trading after the travel company issued an upbeat first quarter revenue outlook, suggesting it's seeing strong demand for premium bookings.\n\nAirbnb forecast revenue between $2.59 ​billion and $2.63 billion for the quarter, compared with analysts' expectations of $2.52 billion, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence consensus estimates.\n\nFourth quarter revenue of $2.78 billion beat expectations of $2.71 billion, but Airbnb's earnings per share in the quarter of $0.56 missed estimates of $0.65, as the company invested heavily in new experiences and offerings.\n\nYahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian reports:\n\nMcDonald's (MCD) said its value campaign to get customers to return to the fast food chain after high prices tarnished its reputation for affordable food is working. And with fourth quarter US same-store sales growing 6.8% during the quarter, there may be some truth to that.\n\n\"We're not going to not win on value,\" CFO Ian Borden told Yahoo Finance. \"We've made, I think, significant progress on our value and affordability platforms and how those are resonating with consumers.\"\n\nIn the first quarter, McDonald's is expected to pull back on the support it sent franchisees for the Extra Value Meal push. But Borden suggested that many locations would keep the meal deal, calling it \"fundamental in the environment that we're operating in today.\"\n\nBorden and McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski also indicated that they're aware of the growing adoption of GLP-1 weight-loss medications, especially now that pill versions are rolling out.\n\n\"As adoption grows, we know that consumers' behavior changes,\" Kempczinski said. \"We know that in general, they eat fewer calories in the day, but also what they eat, the mix of that changes.\"\n\nKempczinski added that the company is factoring in changing diet preferences, such as customers opting for less sugary drinks, into the offerings it is testing.\n\nRead more about how McDonald's is responding to weight-loss drugs here.\n\nFor the latest earnings reports and analysis, earnings whispers and expectations, and company earnings news, click here\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"
