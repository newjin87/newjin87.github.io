        "content": "Shares of Nvidia edged lower on Thursday, even as a Wall Street analyst struck an optimistic tone on the company’s upcoming earnings.\n\nNvidia stock fell 0.15% to $187.16 in Thursday trading. The modest decline came as investors positioned ahead of the company’s earnings report scheduled for next Wednesday.\n\nWall Street expects Nvidia to report adjusted earnings per share of $1.52, representing a 71% increase from $0.89 a year earlier\n\nRevenue is projected to reach approximately $65.67 billion, up about 67% year over year.\n\nFor fiscal 2026, analysts forecast full-year sales of $213.3 billion and adjusted earnings of $4.69 per share.\n\nData centre revenue has remained the primary growth engine for Nvidia, totalling $131.4 billion through the first nine months of the fiscal year.\n\nOppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer said he expects a positive earnings report, highlighting potential upside to consensus estimates.\n\n“We see ‘typical’ $2 billion-$3 billion upside potential to Street sales…led by GB300 Ultra,” Schafer wrote in a research note on Thursday.\n\nWith China representing a potential $50 billion total addressable market, Schafer said Nvidia’s broader addressable market could rise further from its current estimate of around $4 trillion.\n\n“NVDA is the ubiquitous AI platform best positioned to win, in our view,” he wrote.\n\n“China represents incremental $50 billion TAM [total addressable market] pending H200 license approvals, a ‘when’ not an ‘if’ in our view,” he added.\n\nSchafer maintains an Outperform rating on Nvidia shares and a $265 price target.\n\nHe also said the average selling price for Nvidia’s Vera Rubin system is likely to be 40% to 50% above that of GB300, which sold for roughly $3.5 million.\n\nBased on that pricing dynamic, Vera Rubin could contribute approximately $8 billion in additional revenue, according to Schafer.\n\nInvestors are also closely watching capital expenditure plans from major cloud providers.\n\nHyperscaler spending is expected to accelerate into 2026, with indications of roughly $300 billion in AI infrastructure investment for calendar 2026.\n\nMarket participants are seeking confirmation that this spending continues to flow to Nvidia and could potentially exceed current expectations.\n\nRecent capex guidance from companies such as Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet has reinforced expectations of sustained AI infrastructure investment.\n\nAt the same time, supply chain constraints remain a focus.\n\nMemory components and hard disk drives have emerged as bottlenecks, raising questions about whether such constraints could affect the timing of Nvidia’s shipments or data centre buildouts.\n\nInvestors are also looking for updates on AI-related sales into China, which could provide incremental near-term revenue beyond current projections.\n\nDespite the stock’s recent pullback, Nvidia remains on a streak of delivering results above its own quarterly guidance and issuing forward guidance ahead of consensus estimates.\n\nFailed to load articles.

Top stories, top movers, and trade ideas delivered to your inbox every weekday before and after the market closes.\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is heading into its next earnings report with expectations already running high, and Wall Street appears increasingly comfortable with that risk. Several analysts, led by Citigroup, have reiterated bullish views on the stock, arguing that demand for advanced AI hardware remains strong enough to support another leg of growth.\n\nFor investors, the key question is no longer whether Nvidia will beat earnings estimates. It is whether guidance can justify a valuation built on the assumption that AI spending remains durable through 2026 and beyond.\n\nCiti's recent commentary reflects a broader pattern across sell side research. Analysts continue to point to sustained orders for Nvidia's newest data center platforms, including systems built around its latest GPU architecture and high speed networking products.\n\nUnlike earlier in the AI cycle, when demand was concentrated among a few U.S. hyperscalers, the customer base now appears wider. Enterprise adoption, government backed projects, and international infrastructure builds are increasingly part of the revenue mix. That diversification helps support forecasts that data center revenue can remain elevated even if cloud spending growth slows in the United States.\n\nCiti has also emphasized that Nvidia's product roadmap provides visibility that many competitors lack. New chip platforms and system level upgrades give customers reasons to refresh hardware rather than simply sweat existing assets.\n\nFrom an earnings perspective, that matters because it keeps average selling prices high and supports gross margins.\n\nAt this stage of Nvidia's rally, investors are less focused on what happened last quarter and more focused on what management says about the next several.\n\nThe stock's valuation assumes that AI infrastructure spending is not peaking but shifting into a longer buildout phase. That puts pressure on Nvidia's guidance to show that order pipelines remain strong and that customers are planning capacity expansions rather than pauses.\n\nIf management signals that backlog remains healthy and that next generation systems are ramping as expected, analysts are likely to maintain or raise long term revenue estimates. That scenario supports the bullish case that Nvidia's growth story extends well into 2026.\n\nHowever, any hint that customers are delaying purchases or that supply chain constraints are limiting shipments could trigger a sharper market reaction than a simple earnings miss would.\n\nIn this environment, tone and forward commentary may move the stock more than headline numbers.\n\nNvidia's earnings have become a proxy for the broader AI investment cycle. When it beats expectations, markets tend to read that as confirmation that capital spending on data centers and AI systems remains strong.\n\nCiti's optimism is rooted in the idea that AI workloads are still in an early stage of enterprise adoption. Training large models is no longer the only driver. Inference, automation, and industry specific AI applications are creating ongoing demand for compute power.\n\nThat narrative suggests that spending is evolving rather than fading. Instead of one time bursts tied to model launches, Nvidia could benefit from recurring upgrades as companies scale AI into everyday operations.\n\nFor investors, this distinction is important. A one off cycle would justify lower multiples. A multi year infrastructure build supports premium valuations.\n\nEven with positive analyst sentiment, Nvidia's stock remains sensitive to any sign of deceleration. The higher a stock climbs, the less room there is for disappointment.\n\nCiti's bullish stance does not eliminate the risk that expectations have become too optimistic. Revenue growth has been extraordinary, which raises the bar for future comparisons. Any slowdown, even if growth remains strong in absolute terms, could pressure the share price.\n\nThere is also the question of competition. While Nvidia dominates high end AI chips today, rivals are investing heavily in alternative accelerators and custom silicon. Over time, that could compress margins or limit pricing power.\n\nFor now, analysts appear comfortable that Nvidia's software ecosystem and integration advantages give it a defensible lead. But earnings calls will increasingly be judged on how well management explains its competitive moat.\n\nIn the short term, traders will focus on guidance and management's commentary on customer demand. Signs that large buyers are still placing multi quarter orders would likely be taken as bullish.\n\nLong term investors may pay closer attention to capital allocation and product roadmaps. Continued investment in next generation platforms signals confidence in future demand. Any shift toward caution could change the narrative.\n\nAnother factor to watch is geographic expansion. If management highlights growth outside the United States, that supports the idea that AI infrastructure spending is becoming global rather than concentrated in a few tech hubs.\n\nThat would reinforce the argument that Nvidia's growth runway is longer than many skeptics assume.\n\nCiti's bullish view ahead of earnings reflects a broader belief on Wall Street that Nvidia is still in the middle of its AI expansion phase, not at the end of it.\n\nThe upcoming earnings report will test that belief. If guidance confirms that demand for AI systems remains strong and diversified, Nvidia's valuation may continue to look justified to investors focused on long term growth.\n\nIf guidance falls short of that narrative, the stock could face a period of consolidation as expectations reset.\n\nEither way, this earnings report is less about one quarter of results and more about whether Nvidia can keep convincing the market that AI spending is structural, global, and durable rather than temporary and concentrated.\n\nBenzinga Disclaimer: This article is from an unpaid external contributor.
