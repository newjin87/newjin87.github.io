        "content": "A \"buy the rumor, sell the news\" event may take shape, yet again.\n\nFor much of the last three years, artificial intelligence (AI) has been the hottest trend on Wall Street. Providing software and systems with the tools to make accurate, split-second decisions without human oversight is a game changer that's expected to create trillions of dollars in global economic value.\n\nAlthough a long list of publicly traded companies is benefiting from this artificial intelligence push, none exemplify this technological evolution quite like Nvidia (NVDA 2.21%). Since the end of 2022, Nvidia has added nearly $4.2 trillion in market cap and has become the most valuable company on Wall Street.\n\nPerhaps it's no surprise that Nvidia's operating results are the most anticipated of any public company. Though the bulk of earnings season is in the rearview mirror, the star of the show (Nvidia) is set to lift the hood on its fiscal 2026 fourth-quarter operating results (ended Jan. 25, 2026) following the closing bell on Feb. 25.\n\nWhile Nvidia is expected to do what it does best -- decisively surpass the consensus sales and profit forecast of Wall Street analysts -- other factors suggest it'll have a difficult time living up to the lofty expectations of investors.\n\nWhen Nvidia reveals its fiscal fourth-quarter operating results in a little over a week, analysts will be looking for approximately $65.6 billion in sales (up 67% from the prior-year period) and $1.52 in earnings per share (EPS). Considering that Nvidia has topped the consensus EPS estimate by 3% to 8% in each of the last four quarters, there's a good chance Nvidia will clear the bar, yet again.\n\nNvidia's outperformance stems from the insatiable demand for its AI graphics processing units (GPUs). These are the brains that are powering split-second decision-making, generative AI solutions, and large language model training in AI-accelerated data centers.\n\nNvidia's three best-known generations of GPUs, Hopper (H100), Blackwell, and Blackwell Ultra, lack competitors that can match their compute capabilities. Businesses seeking an edge have wisely chosen Nvidia's AI GPUs for their data centers.\n\nTo build on this point, CEO Jensen Huang has been aggressively investing in research and development to ensure his company retains its compute superiority. Nvidia is on track to introduce an advanced GPU each year, with the Vera Rubin chip, powered by the brand-new Vera processor, set to make its debut later this year. External competitors are already struggling to keep pace with Nvidia's prior-generation chips, making it unlikely that Wall Street's most valuable company will face any real compute competition anytime soon.\n\nAdditionally, Nvidia continues to benefit from GPU scarcity. Even with world-leading chip fabricator Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing rapidly expanding its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS) capacity, enterprise demand for AI hardware is handily outstripping supply. This dynamic, coupled with Nvidia's superior compute capabilities, is enabling it to charge a premium price point for its GPUs. The result is a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) gross margin in the mid-70% range.\n\nLastly, give the CUDA software platform its due. This is the dynamic toolkit developers use to maximize the potential of their Nvidia GPUs, and it effectively keeps clients loyal to the company's products and services.\n\nWhile the above catalysts appear to suggest that Nvidia stock can soar on Feb. 25, we may see another example of \"buy the rumor, sell the news\" -- something we've observed following several earnings reports from the face of the AI revolution in recent years.\n\nOne of the challenges Nvidia faces is justifying its premium valuation amid a historically pricey stock market. On the one hand, it offers a near-monopoly in GPUs deployed in AI-accelerated data centers and is deserving of some level of valuation premium. However, backing up its current premium may prove impossible.\n\nBased on what history tells us, companies at the forefront of a game-changing innovation that sport price-to-sales (P/S) ratios above 30 indicate the presence of a bubble. Nvidia's P/S ratio briefly topped 30 in early November and was even higher in previous years. Although its rapidly rising sales are lowering its P/S ratio over time, there's likely not a fiscal fourth-quarter earnings beat and guidance raise sufficient to satisfy investors' lofty expectations.\n\nNvidia's fiscal 2027 outlook also has the potential to disappoint investors. While Nvidia's guidance has a knack for surpassing the consensus of analysts, two factors threaten to weigh on the company's sales growth expectations for its upcoming fiscal year.\n\nFor one, internal competitive pressures are ramping up. Whereas most analysts are focused on external competition from the likes of Advanced Micro Devices or custom AI chip company Broadcom, arguably the biggest threat to Nvidia's margins is its top customers by net sales.\n\nMost members of the \"Magnificent Seven\" have purchased Nvidia's GPUs for their AI-accelerated data centers – and many of these companies are also internally developing GPUs or AI solutions. Even though this in-house hardware can't match the compute capabilities of Nvidia's GPUs, it's markedly cheaper and not backlogged, as has been the case with Hopper, Blackwell, and Blackwell Ultra. There exists a real possibility that Nvidia will lose data center real estate as its top customers deploy their own chips.\n\nThe other factor that can derail investors' lofty expectations for Nvidia's fiscal 2027 is GPU scarcity. As noted, Taiwan Semiconductor has been expanding its monthly CoWoS capacity at a breakneck pace for Nvidia and its competition. As production expands, the aforementioned demand-supply imbalance should be minimized. As GPU scarcity wanes, so should some of Nvidia's pricing power and its premium GAAP gross margin.\n\nEven a perfect quarter from Nvidia is unlikely to support the near-parabolic climb it's delivered over the last three years.\n\n*Average returns of all recommendations since inception.

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) reported Q3 revenue of $57B and guided Q4 to $65B. Nvidia grew revenue 62% year-over-year.\n\nGoldman Sachs projects Nvidia revenue will reach $513B by 2028 versus $400B consensus.\n\nNvidia’s forward P/E sits at 24 with a PEG ratio under 0.5.\n\nSending You to Google News in 3\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA | NVDA Price Prediction) stock has been stuck in neutral since last August, trading in a fairly narrow range around $180 per share as questions about artificial intelligence (AI) spending fester. Despite blowout quarterly numbers and expectations that hyperscalers could spend as much as $700 billion in capex this year on AI — much of it likely going to Nvidia for its latest accelerators like Blackwell — the stock has gone nowhere.\n\nYet there is one staggering number that indicates you should buy Nvidia stock while it is still a bargain because it will soon explode higher.\n\nNvidia reported fiscal third-quarter results in November showing revenue reached a record $57 billion, up 22% sequentially and 62% year-over-year. Data Center revenue — the primary AI driver — hit $51.2 billion, rising 25% from the prior quarter and 66% from a year earlier. Management guided fourth-quarter revenue to $65 billion, plus or minus 2%.\n\nThe AI chipmaker has grown exponentially over the past few years, with revenue surging from earlier bases through relentless demand for its GPUs in AI training and inference. While it might not be able to continue doubling revenue every year — the arithmetic simply gets harder the larger the base becomes — it doesn’t mean Nvidia is still not growing at a breakneck pace. The company’s full-stack ecosystem, including hardware, software like CUDA, and partnerships with model builders, continues to fuel sustained expansion.\n\nAnalysts widely expect the upcoming Q4 report on Feb. 25 to show another beat, with the consensus around $65.6 billion in revenue and potential for larger numbers driven by Blackwell sales ramping higher.\n\nGoldman Sachs wrote in a recent research note that its analysts expect Nvidia to beat fourth-quarter revenue estimates by roughly $2 billion — some 5% higher than consensus forecasts, potentially pushing results toward $67 billion. The firm is also calling for a 9% beat on the consensus for the first quarter of fiscal 2027.\n\nThe truly staggering number comes from Goldman’s revenue projection for 2028: $513 billion, well above the $400 billion consensus and representing a 53% compound annual growth rate from fiscal 2026 estimates of about $215 billion. At that level, Nvidia would be generating well over $1 billion in sales every single day of the year.\n\nThis outlook assumes strong ramps in Rubin GPUs starting in late 2026, continued AI infrastructure demand from hyperscalers, and Nvidia’s dominance in accelerators. Even conservative views see multi-year tailwinds from sovereign AI projects, enterprise adoption, and software monetization.\n\nNvidia’s current valuation appears attractive relative to its growth trajectory. Today, with the stock around $183, the forward P/E ratio sits near 24, a level not seen in nearly a year and close to the S&P 500‘s multiple. The PEG ratio — its valuation relative to its projected earnings growth rate — hovers under 0.5, signaling significant undervaluation. This compression has occurred as short-term concerns over supply constraints and capex sustainability have taken hold, but the chipmaker’s fundamentals remain robust.\n\nFew companies have achieved what analysts are expecting from Nvidia. Walmart (NYSE:WMT) — the world’s biggest sales producer — generated $681 billion in revenue in fiscal 2025. It is expected to grow that some 5% in 2026 and almost 12% in 2027. Even if it continues at that higher rate thereafter — a big assumption — Nvidia will overtake it by 2030 based on Goldman’s trajectory.\n\nThere is just no way Nvidia stock can remain range-bound for very long at that pace. Producing the kind of revenue and profits that it is — backed by hyperscaler spending — means the stock will soon soar higher, making its current very cheap valuation a bargain price to pay. With fourth-quarter results imminent, any beat-and-raise scenario could accelerate the breakout investors have been waiting for.\n\nOur top personal finance-related articles today.
