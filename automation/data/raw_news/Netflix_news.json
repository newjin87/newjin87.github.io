        "content": "Warner Bros. Discovery is weighing a critical decision between two competing billion-dollar offers. The media company’s board is considering whether to reopen talks with Paramount Skydance after rejecting its initial proposal.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery, Inc., WBD\n\nParamount enhanced its $78 billion all-cash offer on February 10. The company added a $650 million quarterly ticking fee if the deal extends past December 31.\n\nThe enhanced terms include coverage of WBD’s $2.8 billion breakup fee to Netflix. Paramount also committed up to $1.5 billion for debt refinancing costs.\n\nThese additions demonstrate Paramount’s determination to win the bidding war. The company believes it can secure regulatory approval faster than Netflix.\n\nNetflix and WBD signed an $82.7 billion agreement in December. That deal is now facing serious challenges from federal regulators.\n\nTrump administration antitrust officials are examining Netflix’s position in the streaming market. A GOP operative familiar with the situation stated the Netflix deal is “going nowhere with the executive branch.”\n\nThe regulatory scrutiny centers on potential streaming monopoly concerns. Officials question whether combining Netflix with HBO Max creates excessive market concentration.\n\nDOJ antitrust chief Gail Slater recently resigned under White House pressure. Her departure could extend the review timeline to six months or longer.\n\nIf the DOJ blocks the deal and Netflix litigates, the process could stretch another year. This uncertainty is pushing WBD to reconsider its options.\n\nWBD must notify Netflix before reopening talks with Paramount. Netflix would then receive an opportunity to match any improved Paramount offer.\n\nCEO David Zaslav is hoping Paramount increases its $30 per share bid. Sources say he wants the total package to exceed $85 billion.\n\nNetflix’s current $27.75 per share offer relies on selling WBD’s cable properties. The valuation of those assets remains uncertain in today’s media landscape.\n\nBoth bidders have indicated willingness to raise their offers. However, Netflix’s stock price declined during the bidding process, potentially limiting its flexibility.\n\nWBD plans to announce its Q4 2025 earnings date this week. Investors are also awaiting the special shareholder vote date on the Netflix transaction.\n\nAncora Holdings accumulated a $200 million stake in WBD. The investment firm publicly opposes the Netflix deal.\n\nDespite this opposition, only 42.3 million shares have been tendered supporting Paramount. That represents less than 2% of outstanding shares.\n\nParamount filed a lawsuit against WBD claiming the company favors Netflix due to personal relationships. The suit alleges CEO Zaslav’s friendship with Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos influenced the decision.\n\nPeople close to Paramount say the company hadn’t heard from WBD about reopening talks as of Sunday night. Some observers believe WBD may be using media leaks to protect against litigation.\n\nAnalysts maintain a cautious outlook on Paramount Skydance. PSKY stock carries a Moderate Sell consensus rating on TipRanks based on zero Buys, one Hold, and three Sells.\n\nThe average price target of $12.33 suggests 19.5% upside from current levels. PSKY shares dropped 8.7% over the past year.\n\nDiscover top-performing stocks in AI, Crypto, and Technology with expert analysis.\n\n📈 Futures & Crypto Trader 🔍 Sharing charts, strategies, & mindset tips to help you level up 🚨 Not Financial Advice Follow on X @Pro_Trader_Edge\n\nType above and press Enter to search.

        "content": "Hyperscaler capex budgets are increasingly inclusive of memory and storage chips.\n\nMicron is a major player in the high-bandwidth memory market.\n\nDespite its explosive growth outlook for 2026, Micron stock trades at a steep discount relative to other AI chip stocks.\n\nSmart investors already know that the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution has served as a generational bellwether for semiconductor stocks. Over the last few years, capital expenditure budgets from the hyperscalers have largely concentrated on buying graphics processing units (GPUs) from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, as well as designing custom silicon with Broadcom.\n\nUnderneath the surface, however, rising infrastructure spend is beginning to fuel a supercycle in another area along the AI chip value chain: memory and storage.\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\n\nLet's dig into why Micron Technology(NASDAQ: MU) is a savvy stock to buy right now as the AI infrastructure era unfolds.\n\nImage source: Micron Technology.\n\nFor years, Micron was perceived as a cyclical semiconductor business -- highly susceptible to boom and bust cycles as consumers upgrade their devices. The AI narrative is completely changing this view.\n\nDevelopers like Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Tesla are building next-generation products featuring humanoid robots, self-driving cars, AI agents, and more. While GPUs help these applications come to life, they are most practical when it comes to training and inferencing models.\n\nAs AI workloads grow, big tech has found that it needs to broaden its budget spending to include more than just adequate capacity protocols. Today, the biggest bottleneck straining AI development is memory and storage.\n\nMicron specializes in high-bandwidth memory (HBM) solutions, offering customers a comprehensive suite of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) and NAND chips. Unsurprisingly, Micron's business saw a pronounced acceleration at this specific juncture in the AI boom.\n\nMicron's business is going to have a great year. How do I know that? Well, consider that management told investors that the company's existing inventory is already sold out. While this is terrific news for now, these supply and demand dynamics would not be a good thing in the long run.\n\nFor this reason, Micron is currently investing in additional manufacturing capacity in order to keep pace with soaring demand. Nevertheless, Wall Street is calling for Micron's revenue and profits to explode in 2026.\n\nThis year, Micron's expected revenue of $76 billion represents 81% growth over its trailing-12-month sales, while the earnings-per-share (EPS) estimates are forecast to roughly triple.\n\nDespite Micron's robust outlook, the company currently trades at a rather pedestrian forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 12. To put this into perspective, let's take a look at the forward P/E levels of other category leaders in the AI chip stack.\n\nTo be fair, Micron does not have the same addressable market as some of its chip cohorts. Nevertheless, the bigger takeaway is that Micron trades at a steep discount relative to other leading AI semiconductor stocks.\n\nFrom a macro perspective, consider the Nasdaq-100 index boasts a forward P/E of 25. Should Micron trade more in line with those levels, shares would reach $843 -- implying about 105% upside from current levels.\n\nDoubling this year could prove daunting. Regardless, I see meaningful upside in Micron stock throughout 2026 and beyond. By the end of the year, I think an appropriate price range for Micron stock could be $650 or more.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Micron Technology, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Micron Technology wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $414,554!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,120,663!*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 884% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 193% for the S&P 500.

        "content": "The S&P 500 has steadily outperformed international stocks since the end of the financial crisis.\n\nThanks to the falling dollar and an improved outlook, international stocks outperformed by a wide margin in 2025.\n\nImproved earnings growth and attractive valuations mean the good times for foreign investing might not nearly be over.\n\n10 stocks we like better than iShares - iShares Msci Emerging Markets ETF ›\n\nInternational stocks finally had a moment of outperformance relative to the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) in 2025. But those moments have been rare over the past several years. With few exceptions, U.S. stocks have steadily and consistently outperformed international stocks since the financial crisis.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\n\nFundamental Chart data by YCharts\n\nBut now it's looking like the pendulum may be ready to swing in the other direction.\n\nWith the S&P 500 at historically high valuations and still very top-heavy with the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, the current rotation away from megacap stocks may provide the opening for a lengthier run for foreign stocks.\n\nIn 2025, the iShares MSCI EAFE ETF (NYSEMKT: EFA) beat the State Street SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: SPY) by a 31.6% to 17.7% margin. The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (NYSEMKT: EEM) did even better by returning 34%.\n\nThe biggest driver hasn't necessarily been the move away from U.S. tech stocks, although that has contributed. It has been the rotation from growth into value. The U.S. labor market continues to slow, and retail sales activity has begun to slip. Investors are hesitant to keep bidding up expensive growth stocks and are interested in something more reasonably valued to provide a bit of protection.\n\nThat move to value, along with a weakening dollar, has helped give international stocks a boost as well.\n\nETF investors have taken notice too. On a relative basis, international and emerging markets equity ETFs have taken in new money over the past year at nearly twice the rate of U.S. equity ETFs.\n\nForeign equities have a number of tailwinds working in their favor.\n\nLower valuations: The S&P 500 currently trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of around 29. International developed and emerging markets stocks trade at 19 and 18 times earnings, respectively. Foreign stocks often trade at lower multiples than U.S. stocks, but the current valuation gap presents an attractive opportunity for those seeking better value.\n\nEconomic tailwinds: Fiscal stimulus efforts in places like Germany, productivity gains, and a lower dollar could accelerate growth rates overseas.\n\nEarnings growth: 2025 saw near-stagnant earnings growth rates in most of Europe and other developed regions. In 2026, estimates call for high single-digit to low double-digit earnings growth rates across developed and emerging markets. This supports the fundamental case for higher stock prices.\n\nDiversification: Many international markets are much less reliant on tech to drive growth. Their exposure to different economic cycles and sector compositions means a potentially different pattern of returns.\n\nEven though the environment for international stocks has improved, a number of risk factors at play could damage momentum.\n\nGeopolitical risk is still front and center. Global trade tensions have intensified, and any further increase in tariff rates is likely to hinder growth potential. A sustainable rebound in the dollar index would act as a headwind for international stocks relative to the S&P 500. Many international economies are cyclically sensitive. Therefore, any slowdown in manufacturing or trade might be felt especially strongly overseas.\n\nGiven that U.S. stocks outperformed pretty much nonstop from the end of the financial crisis through the mid-2020s, it's safe to say that international stocks are long overdue for an extended period of outperformance.\n\nOverall, international stocks are 1) more cyclically sensitive on average than U.S. stocks and 2) demonstrate much better value when considering metrics such as the price-to-earnings ratio. Neither of those has been much help since investors consistently preferred U.S. tech and growth.\n\nSentiment is beginning to change. Value is back in favor, and the comparatively better growth acceleration expectations of international markets could be the thing that finally unlocks it.\n\nIf foreign companies can deliver on those expectations, it could be another good year for international investing.\n\nBefore you buy stock in iShares - iShares Msci Emerging Markets ETF, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and iShares - iShares Msci Emerging Markets ETF wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Sandisk is benefiting from surging demand for AI memory and storage solutions.\n\nDespite the stock's meteoric rise over the past year, Sandisk remains attractively valued compared to other AI chip stocks.\n\nThe momentum in Sandisk stock could just be getting started as hyperscalers double down on their AI capital expenditures.\n\nOne year ago, Sandisk(NASDAQ: SNDK) was spun off from Western Digital (which had bought it in 2016) and once again became an independent, publicly traded company. Since making its second debut on the Nasdaq, Sandisk stock has skyrocketed by more than 1,500%.\n\nLet's dive into the tailwinds that have fueled Sandisk's parabolic price action and consider whether it's still a good time for smart investors to buy the stock.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\n\nBefore examining Sandisk's ascent, investors may find it helpful to understand how Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) became the leader of the AI processor realm. While Nvidia is a diversified business, its bread and butter is designing graphics processing units (GPUs) -- the hardware that provides the key computing power required to develop and deploy AI models.\n\nOver the last few years, hyperscalers like Meta Platforms, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, and OpenAI have collectively spent hundreds of billions of dollars procuring GPUs from Nvidia. As companies accelerate the pace at which they invest in AI, the data workloads involved are scaling at an unprecedented rate.\n\nThis is leading to capacity constraints -- and as demand for additional cloud infrastructure is on the rise, demand for GPUs and other AI processors is outpacing supply. But as the data center buildout continues, another big bottleneck is forming in the high-bandwidth memory (HBM) market.\n\nBig tech is no longer solely focused on securing as many GPUs as possible. Increasing shares of infrastructure budgets are now flowing toward another pocket of the AI chip value chain: dynamic random access memory (DRAM) and NAND solutions. This is where Sandisk enters the picture.\n\nNext-generation products in agentic AI, autonomous systems, and robotics are far more complex than chatbots. These systems must process massive volumes of data, which means they need rapid access to that data from storage in close proximity to the processors. So as AI workloads expand, servers with more robust memory and storage solutions are becoming mission-critical necessities. For this reason, capital expenditures are swiftly rotating toward solid state drives, DRAM, and NAND flash storage -- precisely what Sandisk offers.\n\nAs of this writing (Feb. 11), Sandisk stock is hovering right around $600 per share. Given the price tag, you might think you've missed out on the opportunity to invest in it profitably. However, share price alone doesn't reveal much about a company's underlying valuation.\n\nAccording to analysts' consensus estimates, Sandisk will report earnings per share (EPS) of $39.45 in 2026 and $76.34 in 2027. Despite this robust outlook, it currently trades at a modest forward price-to-earnings multiple of 15.\n\nSNDK PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts. PE = price-to-earnings.\n\nAs the chart above illustrates, other category leaders in the AI chip landscape all boast forward earnings multiples in the mid-20s to low-30s. The next closest comparable valuation to Sandisk is Micron Technology -- another major player in the high-bandwidth memory space.\n\nTo me, these trends hint at something interesting: Growth investors have yet to fully price the upside of rising AI infrastructure spending into the shares of the leaders in the memory and storage market. In other words, despite the jaw-dropping gains it has already made, Sandisk stock is still dirt cheap. Should its valuation profile become more aligned with other AI chip leaders, Sandisk could reasonably soar to $1,000 per share or more by the end of the year.\n\nWhile calling Sandisk the \"next Nvidia\" may be a tad overzealous, I am optimistic that the company will continue rising in a similar fashion to what Nvidia witnessed during the early days of the AI revolution -- making it a compelling buy-and-hold opportunity right now.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Sandisk, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Sandisk wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $414,554!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,120,663!*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 884% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 193% for the S&P 500.
