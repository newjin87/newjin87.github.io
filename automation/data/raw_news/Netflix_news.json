Closing is expected in Q3 2026.\n\nSending You to Google News in 3\n\nAs shares of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) have fallen more than 6% this week, retail investor sentiment on platforms like Reddit and X has shifted noticeably. The stock now trades at ~$76.88, down 26% over the past year and 18% year-to-date. On a pre-split basis, Netflix has tumbled from around $1,323 in June 2025 to an equivalent of $769 today, representing a massive 42% decline. The drop follows mounting uncertainty around its $82.7 billion proposed acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD), which has multiple hurdles to clear before any kind of approval will come through.\n\nMentions of Netflix on Reddit’s r/stocks surged in recent weeks, with users questioning the stock’s steep decline. The most active thread, “What has happened to NFLX stock?” on r/stocks, accumulated 283 upvotes and 309 comments as investors debated the company’s trajectory. As of mid-February, social sentiment has cooled to neutral (42 score) after peaking at very bullish levels (78-82) in late January around the company’s most recent earnings release.\n\nSeveral concerns are driving the cautious tone:\n\nDespite the decline, 34 Wall Street analysts maintain a consensus Buy rating with an average price target of $119, implying 55% upside. Bullish cases point to 26.5% projected EPS growth in 2026 and the company’s expansion into live sports, podcasts, and experiences. Warner Bros. Discovery, trading at $28.12 with a 1.8x price-to-sales ratio, could unlock value if the deal closes.

They cited various reasons, from the tech bubble bursting to geopolitics and macroeconomic factors. Currently, the Nasdaq Composite is hovering around even year to date, while the S&P 500 has risen roughly 1.7%.\n\nCorrections are part of the investment landscape. We had one last year, and there have been eight corrections or bear markets over the past 10 years.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\n\nWhile you can't avoid them, you can prepare for them with stocks designed to zig when the market zags. Here are two within the healthcare sector that may help you do that.\n\nTwo pharmaceutical giants, AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) and Merck (NYSE: MRK), have more in common than just manufacturing drugs. They are both terrific defensive stocks. That means they make products that are in demand in all cycles, because they're just as critical in a downturn as they are in a bull market. However, their effect on a portfolio is much more pronounced during a downturn, when growth stocks tend to struggle.\n\nIn the last few down cycles, both AbbVie and Merck stocks soared. In the 2022 bear market, AbbVie stock jumped 24% for the year, while Merck surged 49%. That year, the S&P 500 finished down 18%. In 2018, when the S&P 500 dropped 4%, AbbVie was down 1%, and Merck rose 40%.\n\nOn the other hand, both stocks do tend to underperform in years when the overall markets are strong. But the long-term numbers are generally in line with the S&P 500. They just don't move in tandem with the large-cap benchmark. AbbVie stock has an average annualized return of 15% over the past 10 years, while Merck is at 10%. For comparison, the S&P 500 has a 10-year annualized return of 14%.\n\nA hallmark of a good defensive stock is its dividend, and both AbbVie and Merck offer robust dividends.\n\nAbbVie just raised its dividend last month by 5% to $1.73 per share at a yield of 3.10%. This is the 13th consecutive year that it has increased its dividend -- something it has done every year since it spun off from Abbott Laboratories in 2013.\n\nMerck pays out a quarterly dividend of $0.85 per share at a yield of 2.99%. Like AbbVie, its yield is some three times the S&P 500 average yield of 1.13%. It has raised its dividend for 15 years in a row.\n\nBoth companies anticipate strong growth in 2026. AbbVie is guiding for adjusted diluted earnings per share of $14.37 to $14.57 per share in 2026, which would be 43% to 45% higher than 2025. Analysts see 12% upside for AbbVie's stock price.\n\nMerck is forecasting worldwide sales of $65.5 billion to $67 billion, which would be up 1% to 3%. Its 2026 earnings outlook is affected by the acquisition of Cidara. But analysts are bullish on Merck, rating it a consensus buy with a $125 per share median price target, which would be up 7%.\n\nThese stocks should not only keep raising their dividends, but also be excellent defensive plays in a market downturn.\n\nBefore you buy stock in AbbVie, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and AbbVie wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $409,108!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,145,980!*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 886% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 193% for the S&P 500.

Those warnings suggest that investors are caught in a high-risk, low-reward environment.\n\nHere are the important details.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\n\nIn late January, the spread between investment-grade corporate bonds and U.S. Treasury bonds narrowed to 71 basis points, according to Bloomberg. That means the average yield on quality corporate debt was just 0.71% higher than the average yield on Treasuries with corresponding maturities.\n\nCredit spreads have not been that tight since 1998. Put differently, not since the dot-com bubble has demand for investment-grade corporate bonds been so immense that investors accepted such a low risk premium.\n\nWhat's the problem? Treasuries are considered risk-free because even the most financially stable business in the world is (arguably) more likely to default than the U.S. government.\n\nSo, there are two ways to interpret the situation. Investors are very confident that companies issuing quality debt (usually to build artificial intelligence infrastructure) will not default. But investors may be too complacent, in which case anything that disrupts the narrative could have profoundly negative consequences for bonds and stocks.\n\nConsider this scenario: If the economic outlook deteriorates (perhaps due to tariffs), demand for corporate debt could fall sharply, causing bond prices to fall and yields to rise. In turn, the stock market could fall sharply because companies would have to pay more to borrow money, which would cut into profits.\n\nThe credit spread between investment-grade corporate bonds and Treasuries is at its tightest level in nearly three decades. That leaves investors in a high-risk, low-reward environment. There is little room for upside because credit spreads can hardly tighten further, but there is plenty of downside risk if the economy stumbles.\n\nThe cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratio was developed by Nobel Laureate Robert Shiller and Harvard professor John Campbell. It measures the valuation of the stock market by dividing its current level by the average inflation-adjusted earnings from the past decade.\n\nThe S&P 500 recorded an average CAPE ratio of 40.1 in January 2026, the highest reading since the dot-com crash in September 2000. The index's monthly CAPE ratio has only been that high 22 times since it was created in 1957 (829 months ago), meaning the stock market has been so expensive less than 3% of the time in history.\n\nHistorically, CAPE ratios above 40 have correlated with modest declines during the next year and steep losses over the next several years. The table shows the S&P 500's best, worst, and average performance over different time periods following CAPE readings above 40.\n\nData source: Robert Shiller. Table by author.\n\nHere's what the table says about the future: If the S&P 500's performance aligns with the historical average, the index will drop 3% by February 2027, 19% by February 2028, and 30% by February 2029. The table also says there is no chance of a positive return in the next three years, even in the best-case scenario.\n\nOf course, past performance is never a guarantee of future results. The CAPE multiple is a backward-looking valuation measure, meaning it does not contemplate the possibility that artificial intelligence will boost profit margins. In that scenario, forward earnings could increase fast enough that the S&P 500 keeps rising while the CAPE ratio falls to a more modest level in coming years.\n\nNevertheless, the current market environment warrants caution. The S&P 500 trades at the high end of its historical valuation range, meaning the stock market's risk-reward profile is skewed toward risk. Now is a good time to sell any stocks you would feel uncomfortable holding through a steep drawdown, and you should limit stock purchases to your highest-conviction ideas.\n\nBefore you buy stock in S&P 500 Index, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and S&P 500 Index wasn’t one of them.

During his first term (Jan. 20, 2017 – Jan. 20, 2021), the widely followed Dow Jones Industrial Average(DJINDICES: ^DJI), broad-based S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), and innovation-inspired Nasdaq Composite(NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) gained 57%, 70%, and 142%, respectively.\n\nSince Donald Trump was inaugurated for his second, non-consecutive term on Jan. 20, 2025, it's been more of the same.

Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\n\nPresident Trump delivering remarks. Image source: Official White House Photo by Shealah Craighead, courtesy of the National Archives.\n\nAlthough stock market volatility has been off the charts at times with Trump in the White House, his policies, including the permanent lowering of the peak marginal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, have lit a fire under Wall Street and driven record share buybacks.\n\nBut when things seem too perfect on Wall Street, they often are. Rumblings of a potential stock market crash in year two of President Trump's second term are mounting. Thankfully, several historically correlated events offer clear insight into the likelihood of a stock market crash taking shape.\n\nBefore going any further, it's important to note that history can't guarantee that something is going to happen on Wall Street. Although history does tend to rhyme on Wall Street, and certain correlated events have flawless track records of foreshadowing the future, nothing should be taken as a concrete guarantee.\n\nNevertheless, the following three data-backed correlations provide a historic glimpse of what to expect in year two of Donald Trump's presidency.\n\nThe first historical marker deserving of attention is the time-tested Shiller Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio, which is also known as the Cyclically Adjusted P/E Ratio, or CAPE Ratio. The S&P 500's Shiller P/E is based on average inflation-adjusted earnings over the previous 10 years and has been back-tested to January 1871.\n\nThis valuation yardstick is particularly useful in determining the relative cheapness or priciness of Wall Street's benchmark index, the S&P 500. Whereas the Shiller P/E has averaged 17.34 over the last 155 years, it ended the Feb. 11 trading session at 40.35. This is the second-priciest stock market in history, trailing only the dot-com era.\n\nS&P 500 Shiller PE Ratio hits 2nd highest level in history 🚨 The highest was the Dot Com Bubble 🤯 pic.twitter.com/Lx634H7xKa\n\nHistory tells us that CAPE Ratios above 30 signal trouble for stocks. The previous five times the Shiller P/E has topped 30 during a continuous bull market, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and/or Nasdaq Composite eventually shed 20% or more of their value. While the timing of this downturn is anyone's guess, the Shiller P/E has made clear that extended valuations aren't well-tolerated on Wall Street.\n\nA second historically correlated event that builds on the Shiller P/E discussion has to do with the nature of next-big-thing technologies. For more than three decades, every game-changing technological innovation has endured a bubble-bursting event.\n\nThe reason bubbles form is that investors overestimate the early stage adoption and/or optimization of next-big-thing innovations. For example, artificial intelligence (AI) is the hottest thing since sliced bread. There are no signs of an adoption problem, with the \"Magnificent Seven\" spending tens, if not hundreds, of billions of dollars on AI data center infrastructure.\n\nHowever, there are optimization concerns. Just because businesses are spending aggressively on AI infrastructure, it doesn't mean AI solutions will be optimized to maximize corporate sales and profits. It took businesses more than half a decade to optimize the internet to bolster their bottom lines, and it'll likely take years for AI to mature and evolve as a technology. If and when the AI bubble bursts, the same companies that led Wall Street higher will likely be the first to drag it down.\n\nThe third correlated event that offers insight is the historical performance of the benchmark S&P 500 during midterm election years. Wall Street and investors love certainty above all else, and elections can quickly strip that away.\n\nGet ready to hear a lot about this, but midterm years tend to see their ultimate low later in the year and have some of the largest intra-year corrections.The good news? Since 1950, off those lows stocks have never been lower a year later and up more than 30% on average. pic.twitter.com/WuWr8vWCJN\n\nEntering the 2026 midterm elections in November, Republicans hold a very slim majority in the House of Representatives. Given that history shows the sitting president's party typically loses seats in Congress in midterm elections, it wouldn't take much of a shift from voters to lead to a divided Congress come January 2027.\n\nAccording to Carson Group's Chief Market Strategist, Ryan Detrick, the average peak-to-trough downturn for the S&P 500 during midterm years is 17.5% since 1950 -- a larger average correction than in other years of a president's term. In Trump's first term, the S&P 500 fell nearly 20% during the midterm elections.\n\nWhile all three of these historically correlated events make clear that double-digit percentage downside is expected in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite, none point to a heightened likelihood of an emotion-driven stock market crash. Although this doesn't rule out an elevator-down crash, investors shouldn't be overly concerned.\n\nWhile several historically flawless correlations paint a rather grim picture for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite over the short term, this outlook completely reverses for investors willing to broaden their perspective.\n\nOn the one hand, stocks can and will go down. No amount of well-wishing or policy maneuvering can stop emotion-driven stock market corrections, bear markets, or the occasional crash from taking shape.\n\nBut what corrections, bear markets, and especially crashes have in common is their propensity to be short-lived. The last two crashes investors observed were resolved in 33 calendar days (the February-March 2020 COVID-19 crash) and four days (April 2, 2025 – April 8, 2025). While investors commonly have their heartstrings pulled during periods of heightened volatility, elevator-down moves are historically unsustainable beyond a few weeks.\n\nMeanwhile, bull markets tend to stick around significantly longer.\n\nThe current bull market -- the \"AI Bull\" -- has eclipsed the 1,200-day mark. This is the 10th bull market to last 1,000+ days based on the 20% rally/decline threshold. Bear markets, on average, are much shorter, at just 286 days, with the longest being 630 days back in... pic.twitter.com/ds7lqWWHFh\n\nRecently, analysts at Bespoke Investment Group updated a data set published on X (formerly Twitter) that examined the calendar-day length of every S&P 500 bull and bear market since the beginning of the Great Depression in September 1929. What this data set shows is a night-and-day difference between bull and bear markets.\n\nWhereas the longest S&P 500 bear market over the last 96 years endured for 630 calendar days, 14 out of 27 S&P 500 bull markets have persisted longer. If the current bull market is still ongoing by late March 2026, 10 of 27 S&P 500 bull markets will have lasted twice as long as the lengthiest bear market.\n\nWhat's more, the average bear market has lasted just 286 calendar days, or approximately 9.5 months. Compared with the typical bear market, the average bull market has persisted 1,011 calendar days, or roughly 3.5 times as long.\n\nThis data demonstrates the power of investor optimism and the value of time in the market.\n\nBefore you buy stock in S&P 500 Index, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and S&P 500 Index wasn’t one of them.

The release of ByteDance’s Seedance 2.0 model shows remarkable video capability and raises new concerns about IP infringement in upcoming years.\n\nNetflix’s $82.7B Warner Bros Discovery bid faces opposition from activist Ancora Holdings favoring Paramount’s competing offer.\n\nMonday.com dropped 25% after withdrawing 2027 guidance due to AI disruption fears, triggering anxiety across media stocks.\n\nSending You to Google News in 3\n\nNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) closed the week at $76.87, down 6.48% from February 6. That’s five times worse than the broader market’s 1.29% decline and leaves the streaming giant down 18% year to date. The stock trades near its 52-week low of $79, a sharp reversal from 2024’s momentum. Three storylines explain what’s happening.\n\nWall Street maintains positive ratings on Netflix despite the recent plunge. The consensus rating sits at “Moderate Buy” with 30 buy or strong buy ratings against 14 holds or sells. The average analyst target of $111.43 implies 45% upside.\n\nThe technical setup supports a contrarian case. The RSI hit 26.8, deep into oversold territory, while the Schaeffer’s Volatility Index sits in the 8th percentile, suggesting excessive bearishness. Options traders are building put positions at the $80 strike, but max pain sits at $90, indicating potential upside if sentiment stabilizes.\n\nThe fundamentals remain intact. Revenue grew 17.6% year over year in Q4 2025, operating margins hit 29.5% for full year 2025, and the company generated $2.66 billion in free cash flow last quarter. Renaissance Technologies loaded up on shares recently, signaling institutional confidence.\n\nNetflix’s $82.7 billion all-cash offer for Warner Bros Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD) faces serious headwinds. Activist investor Ancora Holdings, holding a $200 million stake, is pushing Warner’s board to reject Netflix in favor of Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) Skydance’s competing bid.\n\nParamount sweetened its offer on February 10, adding a “ticking fee” of 25 cents per share per quarter if the deal doesn’t close by year end and pledging to cover Warner’s $2.8 billion breakup fee to Netflix. The tender deadline was extended to March 2.\n\nInvestors worry about leverage. Netflix has historically operated with minimal debt and industry-leading margins. Acquiring Warner would fundamentally change that profile, adding significant debt while integrating HBO, HBO Max, and legacy franchises like Game of Thrones and Harry Potter. Regulatory scrutiny from the DOJ and Senate Judiciary Committee adds another layer of risk. A shareholder vote is expected in March 2026.\n\nMonday.com (NASDAQ:MNDY) dropped 25% this week after withdrawing its 2027 guidance, citing concerns that AI advancements could disrupt its project management business. That spooked investors across software and media sectors.\n\nAnother event that’s dropped like a bomb on media stocks is the release of Seedance 2.0 model from Bytedance. The model creates extraordinary videos and is from China, which raises additional fears about models gaining popularity that won’t comply with U.S. infringement laws.\n\nNetflix isn’t immune to AI anxiety, but it does have weapons many other rivals lack. The company is deploying GenAI tools internally and has 85% of devices on its new TV UI, which leverages machine learning for personalization.\n\nThe real question is whether AI-generated content or new distribution models threaten Netflix’s moat. So far, the company’s scale and content library provide insulation, but the Monday.com selloff shows how quickly sentiment can shift.\n\nNetflix faces a critical stretch.
