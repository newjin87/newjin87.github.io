        "content": "Netflix shares have been battered, but its streaming dominance remains impressive.\n\nWhile Netflix (NFLX 1.27%) generated media excitement with its intention to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD 0.90%), Wall Street was not thrilled with the news. The streaming leader's stock is down 18% in 2026 through the week ending Feb. 13, plunging to a 52-week low of $75.23.\n\nContributing to the sinking share price was activist investor Ancora Holdings' insistence that WBD walk away from the Netflix merger. Ancora holds $200 million in WBD stock and believes the Netflix offer is inferior to the hostile takeover bid from rival Paramount Skydance.\n\nWith Netflix stock struggling, could this be the time to buy or for shareholders to follow Wall Street's lead and sell? Perhaps the best choice is to stand pat if you own shares. Here's a look into Netflix to evaluate a course of action.\n\nOne concern driving Wall Street's selling spree is the enormous debt Netflix took on for the deal. To be clear, the streaming giant is not buying all of Warner Bros. Discovery. It's only purchasing the Warner Bros. portion, which includes the iconic movie studio and HBO brand.\n\nEven so, it had to secure financing to do it. If Netflix prevails in gaining Warner Bros., the combined company will be burdened with an estimated $85 billion in debt. And the chances for the acquisition to go through is another sticking point for Wall Street.\n\nGovernment approval may be hard to obtain. HBO possesses one of the top-ten streaming services in the U.S., and with Netflix the leader in the space, the acquisition could be viewed as harmful to a competitive marketplace.\n\nIf regulatory hurdles sink the deal, Netflix must pay a staggering $5.8 billion break-up fee, one of the largest in history. No wonder Wall Street's worried. But now isn't the time to sell.\n\nIf the acquisition goes through, Netflix's position as an entertainment behemoth increases. It would add HBO's streaming subscribers to its total, which passed 325 million paid members for the first time in 2025.\n\nIt also gains a new revenue stream through Warner's theatrical film releases. To date, subscription fees are Netflix's only material source of sales.\n\nMoreover, Netflix is a major industry player with excellent financials. In 2025, the company generated $45.2 billion in revenue, representing strong 16% year-over-year growth.\n\nThe entertainment titan has rewarded shareholders with rising diluted earnings per share (EPS). Its 2025 diluted EPS of $2.53 is nearly a 30% increase over 2024's $1.98.\n\nAlso, Netflix is a tech company at heart. That strength enabled its streaming success to revolutionize the entertainment industry. Now, it's using artificial intelligence (AI) to streamline operations. For instance, AI is reducing expenses for visual effects and dubbing content into different languages.\n\nWith Netflix stock falling so much, its share price valuation has reached an attractive level, as evidenced by its forward price-to-earnings ratio.\n\nThe chart shows Netflix's forward earnings multiple is at a multiyear low, suggesting it's at a compelling valuation. Combined with the company's growing revenue and EPS, Netflix stock looks like it's in buy territory.\n\nFor investors willing to hold onto Netflix shares for the long haul, the company is well positioned to deliver returns that make it a worthwhile investment.\n\n*Average returns of all recommendations since inception. Cost basis and return based on previous market day close.\n\nInvest better with The Motley Fool. Get stock recommendations, portfolio guidance, and more from The Motley Fool's premium services."

        "content": "Walmart (NASDAQ:WMT), a global retail and e-commerce operator, closed Thursday at $124.87, down 1.38%. The stock moved as investors weighed a solid fiscal Q4 earnings beat and robust e-commerce growth against Walmart’s cautious profit outlook and commentary on a “somewhat unstable” consumer backdrop. Investors are also balancing how guidance shapes expectations for fiscal 2026.Trading volume reached 42.1 million shares, about 34% above its three-month average of 31.4 million shares. Walmart IPO'd in 1972 and has grown 581,123% since going public.\n\nThe S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) slipped 0.29% to 6,862, while the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX:^IXIC) declined 0.31% to finish at 22,683. Among discount stores, Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) closed at $987.82 (-0.83%) and Target (NYSE:TGT) finished at $115.66 (+0.00%), underscoring mixed sentiment across large retail peers.\n\nWalmart had significant increases in e-commerce and online pickup and delivery orders, especially among consumers with higher incomes. But investors felt its cautious outlook may signal a tough road for the stock price going forward.\n\nIn Walmart’s first earnings report since John Furner took over as CEO on Feb. 1, the company reported holiday-quarter sales rose 5% on a constant-currency basis. Operating income grew nearly 11%, as e-commerce sales grew 25% globally and 27% in the U.S.\n\nThat beat estimates and showcased how returns from tech and AI investments are paying off. With shares recently up over 20% just this year and with cautious comments especially about low-income consumers, investors took some profits today.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Walmart, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Walmart wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $420,595!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,152,356!*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 899% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 194% for the S&P 500.

Continue »\n\nGlobal-E Online reported its fourth-quarter results before the U.S. markets opened on Wednesday. They were good, as both adjusted earnings per share and revenue handily beat Wall Street's estimates.\n\nRevenue of $336.7 million, up 28% from a year ago, drove adjusted earnings per share of 49 cents, up from 30 cents per share in the year-ago period. Gross merchandise value (GMV), a key operating metric for the company's management, was $2.36 billion, up 37.8% from the prior year. The company's fourth-quarter launches included a slew of big-name luxury and consumer brands.\n\nBut its 2026 guidance is probably what had investors most excited.\n\nGlobal-E Online sees strong demand continuing throughout the year. Its guidance calls for first-quarter revenue between $247 million and $254 million and full-year sales between $1.21 billion and $1.27 billion. Both ranges were higher than analysts had expected.\n\n\"We are excited about the opportunities and the pipeline that we see ahead of us, as is evident from our 2026 outlook,\" CEO Amir Schlachet said in a statement.

        "content": "A surprising CEO change and weak profit forecast tanked this fintech stock.\n\nThe bulls will focus on PayPal's network effect and cheap valuation.\n\nThere’s no reason to believe the business can accelerate growth, which will damp market sentiment.\n\nJust when investors thought that things couldn't get any worse, the market surprised them. PayPal(NASDAQ: PYPL), once a booming player in the digital payments space, is crashing again. After it reported fourth-quarter 2025 financial results, the share price immediately plunged 20%. It's down 30% this year (as of Feb. 17), while trading about 87% below its record.\n\nThis fintech stock lives in bear market territory. Should investors buy PayPal now?\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\n\nWhen PayPal reported its latest results, there were likely two key developments that led the investment community to worry.\n\nThe first is that the business is bringing in Enrique Lores, chief executive officer at HP since November 2019 and a member of PayPal's board of directors since June 2021, as new CEO. This was a huge surprise, as there was no talk of a potential leadership change. Alex Chriss, PayPal's CEO since September 2023, is stepping down at the end of this month after 2 1/2 years leading the company.\n\nInvestors weren't happy with the company's outlook, either. PayPal provided a forecast of adjusted earnings per share to come in at a \"low-single digit decline to slightly positive\" in 2026. Sell-side analysts were looking for an 8% gain.\n\nDespite PayPal's stock tanking, there are some positive factors to keep in mind.\n\nAs a two-sided payment platform with 231 million monthly active accounts that include merchants and consumers, PayPal benefits from a network effect. To be clear, though, this is a common trait in the payments industry. However, the business does have a solid competitive position, and there is a notable value proposition for its user base.\n\nPayPal generates sizable free cash flow, totaling $5.6 billion in 2025. Management focuses on stock buybacks as a staple of its capital allocation policy, with plans to repurchase $6 billion worth of shares this year. With the valuation so low, as the stock trades at a beaten-down price-to-earnings ratio of 7.5, this could be a good move by the leadership team.\n\nIt's really challenging to be optimistic about PayPal right now, though. That's why I don't believe investors should take a chance on the stock.\n\nAlex Chriss was doing the right things, like emphasizing product innovation and driving operational efficiencies. But this didn't help to accelerate growth. There's no reason to believe the new CEO can be successful in this regard, especially since there's so much competition in the payments industry these days.\n\nUnless revenue can start to increase at a faster clip, and engagement can pick up, it will be extremely difficult for market sentiment to turn positive.\n\nBefore you buy stock in PayPal, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and PayPal wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "On February 13, Chief Market Strategist at Carson Group Ryan Detrick and CEO of MCC Global Enterprises Michelle Caruso-Cabrera joined CNBC to discuss rising geopolitical tensions, tariff shifts, and whether tech weakness is a buying opportunity. Detrick shifted the focus to market performance and noted that it is Friday the 13th ahead of the President’s Day long weekend.\n\nDespite the geopolitical tension, he highlighted that the S&P 500 and the Dow have both risen for nine consecutive months on a total return basis. However, he warned that the second half of February is a period where the market could see a 5% dip due to high optimism and put-to-call ratios. Despite this potential short-term slip, he maintained that the bull market remains intact with solid fundamentals.\n\nCaruso-Cabrera added that the market has shifted to a state of indiscriminate selling. She critiqued the current Netflix or Blockbuster mentality and argued that not every AI company will destroy every legacy company. Detrick agreed and pointed out that short interest in the XLK (Tech ETF) has soared to its highest level in years. He revealed that the Carson Group has actually added to tech and software positions and noted that software valuations are at their cheapest since 2013, viewing it as a buying opportunity.\n\nThat being said, we’re here with a list of the 10 best growth stocks to buy for the next 20 years.\n\nWe used the Finviz stock screener to find growth stocks with at least 20% EPS growth in the past 5 years and at least 20% expected EPS growth for the next year. We then selected 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2025.\n\nNote: All data was sourced on February 18.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 427.7% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 264 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 21\n\nAkebia Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:AKBA) is one of the best growth stocks to buy for the next 20 years. On February 6, Piper Sandler analyst Allison Bratzel lowered the firm’s price target on Akebia to $4 from $6 and kept an Overweight rating. This adjustment was made as part of a broader review of commercial-stage companies, with the firm updating estimates and price targets following several year-end preliminary reports and ahead of official Q4 2025 results.\n\nIn Q3, Akebia Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:AKBA) reported total revenue of $58.8 million with a net income of $540,000, successfully pivoting from a $20 million net loss in Q3 2024. While the launch of its dialysis drug Vafseo saw lower-than-expected revenue of $14.3 million due to operational and adherence hurdles, the company expanded its patient access to 70,000 and reached a milestone of over 700 active prescribers.\n\nDespite an anticipated temporary revenue dip in Q4 due to inventory adjustments at US Renal Care, management projects growth to resume in Q1 2026. The company remains focused on its 2026 pipeline outlook, including the initiation of a Phase 2 rare kidney disease study, while maintaining that its current cash reserves are sufficient to fund its path toward sustained profitability.\n\nAkebia Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:AKBA) is a biopharmaceutical company that develops and commercializes therapeutics for patients with kidney diseases.\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 27\n\nLiveRamp Holdings Inc. (NYSE:RAMP) is one of the best growth stocks to buy for the next 20 years. On February 6, DA Davidson lowered its price target on LiveRamp to $35 from $45 with a Buy rating. Although the company exceeded top and bottom-line expectations in FQ3 2026, management left its fiscal year 2026 guidance unchanged. The analyst attributed this cautious outlook to the timing of specific project-based expenses shifting into FQ4 and marketplace growth that came in softer than previously anticipated.\n\nIn its FQ3 earnings report posted a day prior, LiveRamp Holdings Inc. (NYSE:RAMP) announced revenue growth of 9% year-over-year to $212 million. Management highlighted a significant strategic partnership with Publicis and the expansion of its Data Marketplace to include AI models and agents, which they believe positions the firm for double-digit growth in fiscal year 2027.\n\nWhile the company is successfully growing its high-value million-dollar-plus accounts, subscription net retention compressed to 101%, and gross margins are expected to dip slightly as backend platform upgrades conclude. Looking ahead to FQ4, LiveRamp projected a sequential increase in operating expenses of $15 million due to seasonal events and compensation adjustments, while providing a full-year revenue guidance range of $810 million to $814 million.\n\nLiveRamp Holdings Inc. (NYSE:RAMP) is a technology company that operates a data collaboration platform in the US, Europe, the Asia-Pacific, and internationally.\n\nHeadlineNYSE:LLYNYSE:FICONYSE:ANETNYSE:KVYONYSE:RAMPNASDAQ:AKBANASDAQ:UPSTNASDAQ:LRCXNASDAQ:DKNGNASDAQ:CLBTDaily NewsletterKlaviyo Inc.
