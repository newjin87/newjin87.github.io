        "content": "Bill Ackman's Pershing Square took a new position in a large-cap AI stock.\n\nIt's a concentrated position, amounting to 10% of the fund.\n\nThe stock trades at a valuation in line with the market, despite having extraordinary and unique characteristics.\n\nBig-name value investors are few and far between today, but Bill Ackman, founder of hedge fund Pershing Square Holdings(OTC: PSHZF), remains near the top of the list. As such, those who practice the art and science of value investing would do well to pay attention to his big portfolio moves. After all, Ackman tends to take large, concentrated positions, indicating a high level of conviction.\n\nAt its recent investor presentation, Ackman revealed Pershing had exited its longtime position in Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG), using those proceeds to allocate roughly 10% of its portfolio to this brand-name AI stock.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\n\nOn Wednesday, during Pershing's annual investor presentation, Ackman revealed a roughly $2 billion stake in Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), taken last quarter, amounting to nearly 10% of Pershing's Fund.\n\nIt's no surprise that Ackman invested in the social media giant. After all, Ackman also invested in Meta's digital ad peer Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) three years ago, which has more than tripled since then.\n\nPershing accumulated its stake in Meta following Meta's third-quarter earnings report in late October, which was followed by a big sell-off in the stock. On that earnings release, Meta also gave a preliminary spending outlook for 2026 that hinted at much higher AI investments, saying its capital expenditures would be \"notably larger\" this year and grow at a \"significantly faster percentage rate\" than 2025.\n\nWhile Meta also reported accelerating revenue growth at the time, its spending plans spooked investors, triggering a severe sell-off. Meta stock fell from roughly $750 per share before earnings to below $600 in the immediate aftermath. The stock has since recovered to the high $600s after a strong fourth quarter report, and Pershing revealed that its cost basis in the stock is around $625 per share.\n\nThis earnings season, investors have continued to be skittish about the massive amount of AI-related infrastructure spending announced by other Magnificent Seven stocks besides Meta. It's a fair concern; after all, those huge spending plans will likely eat up all the free cash flow of these companies, forcing even the most financially stable of the large tech giants to take on debt.\n\nAnd while the payoff may look uncertain right now, it's also possible all that spending will create tremendous value. After all, Warren Buffett once said, \"The best business to own is one that over an extended period can employ large amounts of incremental capital at very high rates of return.\"\n\nOne of the main attributes Ackman likes about Meta is that even if the company's huge investments don't result in artificial general intelligence or any dramatically successful new business lines, Meta's core social media properties will still benefit. In the Pershing presentation, Ackman made the point that the, \"overbuilding risk [is] mitigated by the core business's ability to grow into and absorb excess capacity.\"\n\nThis is because Meta has demonstrated the ability to use AI to increase engagement and grow usage on its core Facebook and Instagram platforms. Beyond engagement, AI can also help advertisers create ads and target users with high precision. Greater ad effectiveness enables Meta to charge ever-increasing prices per ad, further accelerating revenue growth.\n\nThe benefits of Meta's AI investment have been evident over the past year, as Meta's revenue accelerated from 16% growth in Q1 to 26% in Q3. While the fourth quarter's growth slightly decelerated to 24%, that quarter also lapped last year's presidential election, when political ad spending was elevated relative to 2025.\n\nGiven the success of its past AI spending, it stands to reason that Meta could see even greater revenue and profit acceleration with its higher levels of investment.\n\nAlthough Meta has a unique advantage over most other businesses, the stock is still not expensive. In fact Meta trades at only 21.8 times 2026 earnings estimates, about in line with the S&P 500 Index. However, if one strips out Meta's billions of spending on the Metaverse, which Ackman rightly points out could be pulled back or canceled at management's discretion without affecting near-term results, then the multiple on the \"core\" business is only 18 times earnings.\n\nIt is somewhat incredible that Meta's social media platforms, which have over 3.5 billion daily active users and significant network effects, are trading at a discount to the overall market. And yet, that does appear to be the case.\n\nMeta is really the only large tech company outside of the cloud computing infrastructure companies with the financial means to invest in AI infrastructure.\n\nWhile investors are growing uneasy about all that spending, each of these companies could also dial back those investments if AI algorithms hit a scaling limit. However, if these massive investments create a wide moat, then the upside could be tremendous.\n\nIn short, Ackman's Meta investment isn't particularly novel, but it does looks smart.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

Read more here.\n\nShares of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) are trading at $668.69, essentially flat over the past week with a 0.04% decline, coinciding with a noticeable shift in retail investor sentiment on platforms like Reddit and X. Social sentiment has cooled to 44.7 for the week ending February 12, down from 57.5 over the prior month. The mixed reaction follows Meta's January 28 earnings beat and announcement of a $10 billion data center in Lebanon, Indiana, part of a broader $115-135 billion capex plan for 2026 focused on AI infrastructure.\n\nSocial sentiment for Meta's $10B AI data center investment has cooled to 44.7 this week, a downward shift from the previous monthly average, influenced by retail skepticism despite a positive Wall Street outlook.\n\nMentions of META on Reddit increased sharply following the company's earnings announcement, with users expressing skepticism about whether the aggressive AI spending will deliver returns. While Meta beat expectations with $59.89 billion in Q4 revenue and $8.88 EPS, the capex guidance raised eyebrows. Traders on Reddit have been comparing Big Tech's capital spending arms race, with discussions highlighting concerns about AI monetization execution.\n\nWhy does the massive spending Meta does on projects like AI and the metaverse not seem to affect the stock price?by u/Embarrassed-Egg-545 in stocks\n\nThe tone of discussion has turned cautious, with retail investors pointing to specific concerns:\n\nReality Labs continues to lose billions despite years of investment in VR and AI devices\n\nThe $135 billion capex commitment represents nearly double the prior year's spending\n\nOperating margins compressed to 41% from 48% due to a 40% cost increase\n\nDespite retail skepticism, Wall Street analysts remain bullish.

The consensus among 67 analysts shows 11 Strong Buy and 51 Buy ratings, with an average target of $859.85, representing roughly 29% upside from current levels. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Meta's primary competitor in digital advertising and AI infrastructure, faces similar dynamics with $175-185 billion in 2026 capex plans. For investors watching Meta, the key question is whether 24% revenue growth and improving AI monetization can absorb the infrastructure costs, or whether margin pressure will force a strategic rethink.\n\nMost Americans drastically underestimate how much they need to retire and overestimate how prepared they are. But data shows that people with one habit have more than double the savings of those who don’t.\n\nAnd no, it’s got nothing to do with increasing your income, savings, clipping coupons, or even cutting back on your lifestyle.

        "content": "Pinterest (PINS) stock plunged 22% after Q1 revenue guidance of $951M to $971M missed $981M consensus.\n\nLarge retail advertisers pulled back Pinterest spending due to tariff pressures and margin concerns.\n\nSeven firms downgraded Pinterest with price targets slashed from $38-40 range to $19-25.\n\nA recent study identified one single habit that doubled Americans’ retirement savings and moved retirement from dream, to reality. Read more here.\n\nPinterest (NYSE:PINS) should be ideally suited to benefit from rising digital advertising budgets. With 619 million monthly active users sharing ideas on products like fashion and home decor, the platform captures clear buying intent that advertisers can target directly. This setup should drive strong revenue growth in a market projected to expand.\n\nYet, following its fourth-quarter earnings release yesterday after the markets closed, the stock is getting crushed in morning trading, plunging more than 22% and erasing billions in market value. Why is a stock that should be doing so well performing so poorly?.\n\nPinterest reported Q4 revenue of $1.3 billion, a 14% increase year over year, though it fell short of the $1.33 billion analyst consensus. Global monthly active users hit a record 619 million, up 12% from the prior year, marking the 10th consecutive quarter of all-time highs. Adjusted EBITDA reached $542 million, with a 41% margin, reflecting operational efficiency. Net income, however, dropped 85% to $277 million, impacted by higher costs and comparisons to the previous year's elevated figures.\n\nDespite these positives, its outlook weighed heavily. For the first quarter, Pinterest guided revenue to $951 million to $971 million, representing 11% to 14% growth but below the $981 million expected by analysts. Management attributed the shortfall to pullbacks from large retail advertisers facing tariff pressures, particularly in Europe, where ad pricing declined 19% amid a 41% rise in impressions. CFO Julia Donnelly noted second-order effects from global retailers recalibrating budgets due to margin concerns.\n\nThe weak guidance triggered a wave of downgrades. At least seven firms, including JPMorgan Chase, Evercore ISI, Bank of America, Loop Capital, RBC Capital Markets, Citi, and Baird, shifted ratings to neutral or hold equivalents. Price targets were slashed, with many now in the $19 to $25 per share range, down from prior levels like $38 to $40 per share. Analysts cited decelerating revenue growth, intensifying competition, and limited visibility amid sales reorganization.\n\nEvercore highlighted a widening gap between Pinterest's growth and the sector, while Bank of America pointed to unmet expectations on engagement improvements. JPMorgan noted revenue headwinds from tariffs could worsen in Q1. These moves reflect worries over slowing ad momentum in a market where digital spending remains robust overall.\n\nPinterest's visual discovery model should appeal to advertisers seeking intent-driven placements, but it struggles to attract budgets compared to giants like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). Meta's suite of social media sites, including Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, boast over 3 billion users, offering unmatched scale for broad reach. Advanced targeting tools, such as custom audiences, lookalikes, and CRM integrations, enable precise optimization across the full funnel.\n\nIn contrast, Pinterest's 619 million users are more niche, focused on planning and inspiration, which suits certain industries like beauty or home goods but limits appeal for impulse buys or wider demographics. Advertisers often favor Meta for its superior ROI through features like Conversion Leads optimization and established attribution. Competition from Google, TikTok, and Reddit (NASDAQ:RDDT) further fragments spending, as Pinterest's smaller audience and higher female skew reduce its priority.\n\nWhile Pinterest invests in AI for visual search and Performance+ ads, execution lags behind Meta's dominance in direct-response campaigns.\n\nPinterest's stock has shed about 53% over the past year and is trading near six-year lows around $14.50 per share. No clear reversal signs appear to be on the horizon amid ongoing ad headwinds and competitive pressures. Yet, valuations look cheap: a trailing P/E of 5, forward P/E of 7, and P/S of 2.4 are all near historical lows. Its enterprise value stands at $7.3 billion, with strong liquidity, including a current ratio of 8.36.\n\nPinterest's recovery hinges on stabilizing ad demand, successful sales restructuring, and AI-driven monetization gains. Management expects flat 2026 adjusted EBITDA margins at 30%, balancing its investments with savings. Analysts, though, warn Pinterest's fundamentals are deteriorating, with tariffs and retailer caution continuing.\n\nWhile undervaluation suggests upside potential to $30 by 2027 if growth hits 14.9% annually, cheap stocks are often cheap for a reason and can stay discounted if challenges grow.\n\nMost Americans drastically underestimate how much they need to retire and overestimate how prepared they are. But data shows that people with one habit have more than double the savings of those who don’t.\n\nAnd no, it’s got nothing to do with increasing your income, savings, clipping coupons, or even cutting back on your lifestyle. It’s much more straightforward (and powerful) than any of that. Frankly, it’s shocking more people don’t adopt the habit given how easy it is."

        "content": "Big Tech keeps raising its spending plans for artificial intelligence infrastructure, yet shares of Nvidia Corp., one of the biggest beneficiaries of that flood of cash, have been largely stagnant for months.\n\nThe stock is up less than 1% since the beginning of the fourth quarter and has been largely range bound despite hitting a record high in late October. It’s also barely beating the S&P 500 Index to start 2026, a slowdown from Nvidia’s nearly 40% leap in 2025 following two consecutive years of triple-digit percentage gains.\n\nEven ballooning capital spending from Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc. — estimated to exceed $600 billion in 2026 — hasn’t been enough to meaningfully boost the stock amid increasing anxieties about returns on those investments.\n\n“There is perhaps growing concern that the ultimate revenue from AI will simply not keep up with the capex spend that’s been announced,” said JoAnne Feeney at Advisors Capital Management, adding that more spending now raises the probability that the market will reach satiation faster.  It’s “going to move up the date at which they pause and let the new compute be digested.”\n\nThe cyclical nature of the chip industry is baked into Nvidia’s valuation, which has compressed as revenue growth is expected to slow in the coming years. Sales are projected to expand 58% in the current calendar year and 28% in 2027, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nNvidia shares trade around 24 times profit estimates, roughly in-line with the Nasdaq 100 index and a slight premium to the S&P 500. Even though this price-to-earnings ratio is far below the five-year average for the stock at 38 times, investors aren’t counting it as a discount.\n\nValuations for infrastructure providers like Nvidia are likely to move lower as growth in capital spending decelerates, according to UBS strategists led by Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi.\n\n“Capex growth is likely to moderate from these levels, which could improve investor perceptions of those doing the spending, but is a potential negative for some companies in the enabling layer,” they wrote in a note dated Feb. 10.\n\nThe next catalyst for Nvidia shares is its upcoming earnings report, due Feb. 25 after markets close. Investors will be focused on Nvidia’s guidance and demand for chips, which have accounted for a large chunk of hyperscaler spending in recent years.\n\n“It really does just come down to the valuation and how rich the company already is,” said Shelby McFaddin, an investment analyst at Motley Fool Asset Management. Investors want to “wait a second and actually see what Nvidia has to say about it before we reward them.”\n\nWall Street analyst estimates for Nvidia’s revenue and earnings in 2026 have barely budged since the tech giants revealed their mega-spending plans. Of course, analysts are likely waiting to hear from Nvidia before making changes to their models.\n\nAfter a big stock run up like Nvidia has had, it’s natural for there to be a period of consolidation, but sentiment can change rapidly, said Jim Thorne, chief market strategist at Wellington-Altus.\n\n“It’s psychology,” Thorne said. “All of a sudden everybody believes the story and the stock goes crazy up.”\n\n–With assistance from Eric J. Weiner and Matt Turner.\n\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com"

        "content": "Corning (GLW) surged 50.2% year-to-date after securing a $6B multiyear fiber optic supply deal with Meta for AI data centers.\n\nCorning beat Q4 earnings and achieved its 20% operating margin target one year ahead of schedule.\n\nCorning’s Optical Communications segment grew 24% to $1.70B. Enterprise sales within the segment jumped 58% from Gen AI adoption.\n\nSending You to Google News in 3\n\nCorning Incorporated (NYSE:GLW) has delivered one of 2026’s most impressive rallies, climbing 50.2% year-to-date and 46% over the past month. Corning’s 2026 is so good, it’s now the 6th top performing stock in the entire S&P 500.\n\nThe 175-year-old materials science company is riding three converging waves: stellar earnings execution, a massive partnership with Meta, and surging demand for AI data center infrastructure. The question now is whether this momentum can sustain itself through the rest of the year.\n\nCorning’s Q4 2025 results, reported on January 28, 2026, set the stage for the rally. The company posted EPS of $0.72, beating Wall Street’s $0.7125 estimate, while revenue hit $4.412 billion against expectations of $4.396 billion. That marked the fourth consecutive quarter of earnings beats in 2025, with full-year core EPS climbing 26% and operating margins expanding 390 basis points to 20.2%.\n\nCEO Wendell P. Weeks highlighted the company’s transformation: “Since the launch of Springboard two years ago, we have transformed Corning’s financial profile. We now have a highly profitable launch point for future growth.” The company achieved its 20% operating margin target a full year ahead of schedule, and management upgraded its Springboard plan to target $11 billion in incremental annualized sales by 2028, up from the original $8 billion goal.\n\nYet, while Corning’s earnings beat Wall Street’s expectations, they certainly didn’t merit a 50% climb in share price. That’s where many recent events come into play.\n\nThe real catalyst arrived on February 3 when Corning announced a multiyear partnership with Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META | META Price Prediction) valued at up to $6 billion for fiber optic cable supply to power AI data centers. The stock surged 18.3% in a single session, hitting an all-time high of $117.56 on February 6. This represented the first record closing high since the dot-com bubble era!\n\nThe Meta agreement validates Corning’s strategic bet on optical connectivity for AI infrastructure. The company’s Optical Communications segment posted 24% year-over-year growth in Q4, reaching $1.70 billion in revenue. Enterprise sales within that segment jumped 58% in Q3, driven by Gen AI product adoption. UBS analyst Joshua Spector raised his price target from $109 to $125, noting that the expanding optical deal pipeline includes additional agreements similar to Meta’s that aren’t yet reflected in guidance.\n\nCorning’s Q1 2026 outlook calls for core sales growth of approximately 15% to a range of $4.2 billion to $4.3 billion, with core EPS between $0.66 and $0.70. The company is expanding production capacity, including breaking ground on a new optical connectivity facility in India expected to open later in 2026.\n\nThe stock now trades at a trailing P/E of 72x and forward P/E of 42x, reflecting aggressive growth expectations. Wall Street now expects earnings to reach $3.08 in 2026 (from $2.52 last year), and grow all the way to $7.01 by 2030. That is to say, the Street expects earnings to nearly triple by the beginning of the next decade. That’s why shares have been outperforming so strongly in 2026.\n\nWall Street’s consensus target sits at $114.46, with 11 of 14 analysts rating the stock a buy or strong buy. The key question is whether hyperscaler demand for optical fiber can sustain this momentum, especially as insider selling has picked up and valuation multiples stretch well above historical norms. For investors who believe AI infrastructure buildout is just beginning, Corning’s positioning as the critical enabler of high-bandwidth connectivity makes the premium valuation defensible.\n\nOpenAI vs. Google And What Investors Can Expect From Other Titans In 2026\n\nSee us invest in our favorite AI stock ideas for free\n\nLive Updates Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg Discusses Opportunities Beyond Ads on Q4 Conference Call Jan 28, 2026 at 5:31 PM…\n\nLive Updates Post Mid-Day Market Recap Jan 27, 2026 at 1:46 PM EST The S&P 500 is up modestly to…\n\nLive Updates Comparison Review Dec 2, 2025 at 4:30 PM EST Marvell’s growth sits between NVIDIA’s 62.5% revenue expansion and…\n\nArm Holdings reports FY2026 Q3 earnings today, Feb. 4, after market close.
