The stock is down 11.91% over one year and 13% from where the stock closed after Meta’s recent blowout earnings.\n\nMeta guided to $115B to $135B in capital expenditures for 2026 for AI infrastructure.\n\nBill Ackman disclosed a significant stake in Meta on February 11. He called it one of the world’s greatest businesses.\n\nSending You to Google News in 3\n\n© Kelly Sullivan / Stringer / Getty Images North America\n\nMeta Platforms closed the week at $639.77, down 3.28% from February 6. The S&P 500 fell just 1.29% over the same period, while the Nasdaq 100 dropped 1.27%. It’s another losing week for Meta, and the stock is now down 13% from where it closed the day after reporting blowout earnings.\n\nLet’s dive into the three storylines that drove price action for Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META | META Price Prediction) this week.\n\nYear to date, Meta is down 3.08%, trading below where it closed December 31. Over one year, shares are off 11.91% from February 13, 2025. This week’s drop pushed the stock further from its 52-week high of $795.06. The question is whether the three developments that shaped this week signal opportunity or warning.\n\nOn February 11th, Pershing Square’s Bill Ackman disclosed a significant new stake in Meta, describing it as “one of the world’s greatest businesses” with strong long-term upside from AI integration. Ackman dumped Chipotle, Nike, and Hilton to make room for Meta, Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN), and Alphabet. That’s a bet on the Magnificent Seven over consumer discretionary, reflecting conviction that Meta’s AI infrastructure investments will pay off.\n\nReddit’s retail traders noticed. Sentiment spiked to 80 on February 11 at 9pm ET, the highest reading of the week.\n\nI defended the trade on 24/7 Wall St. yesterday. Amazon now trades for half the forward P/E of Walmart. Meta is now down 13% from posting outstanding earnings and once again proved its AI spend is going to drive significant revenue acceleration. The sell-off in these names feel more than overdone right now.\n\nMeta guided to $115 to $135 billion in capital expenditures for 2026, a staggering commitment to AI infrastructure and technical talent.\n\nThat’s up from $21.4 billion in Q4 2025 alone, which already represented a 48% increase year over year. Operating margin declined to 41% from 48% as total costs rose 40% year over year.\n\nZuckerberg framed it as necessary: “I’m looking forward to advancing personal superintelligence for people around the world in 2026.” The market isn’t sure the payoff justifies the cost. Corning announced a $6 billion multiyear fiber optic supply deal with Meta for AI data centers, and Vistra secured a 20-year power purchase agreement for zero-carbon nuclear energy to power those facilities. Meta is building the infrastructure. Whether it generates returns that exceed the capital deployed is the bet.\n\nDespite the massive capex raise, Wall Street has increased its earnings estimates for 2027 from where they were before earnings. A month ago, Wall Street was projecting $33.33 in adjusted EPS in 2027. Now that figure sits at $34.33. Revenue acceleration is outpacing margin erosion driven by increased infrastructure spending.\n\nWall Street analysts maintain an average target price of $860.08, implying 34% upside from current levels. The analyst community breaks down as 11 Strong Buy ratings, 51 Buy ratings, and just 5 Hold ratings with no Sell recommendations. Our proprietary 24/7 Wall St price target is also bullish on Meta, assigning the company a target price of $769.98.\n\nThat’s overwhelming bullish consensus, yet the stock fell this week. The disconnect suggests analysts believe in the long-term AI story while the market worries about near-term margin compression. Meta’s forward P/E of 22 looks reasonable if operating income will exceed 2025 levels as management projects. It looks expensive if the $135 billion in CapEx doesn’t pay off until 2028 or later.\n\nThe week’s performance tells you the market is still deciding which scenario to price in.\n\nOpenAI vs. Google And What Investors Can Expect From Other Titans In 2026\n\nSee us invest in our favorite AI stock ideas for free\n\nBill Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital made a significant portfolio shift, selling its entire stake in Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) and…\n\nShares of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META | META Price Prediction) surged 10.4% on January 29, 2026, the day after the company…\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META | META Price Prediction) became the centerpiece of Bill Ackman’s…\n\nAmazon (Nasdaq: AMZN | AMZN Price Prediction) shares tumbled after the e-commerce and cloud giant reported fourth-quarter earnings on February…\n\nShares of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META | META Price Prediction) are trading at $668.69, essentially flat over the past week with…\n\nLive Updates Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg Discusses Opportunities Beyond Ads on Q4 Conference Call Jan 28, 2026 at 5:31 PM…\n\nWhen Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL | GOOGL Price Prediction) announced 2026 capital expenditure guidance of $175-$185 billion during its Q4 2025 earnings…\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META | META Price Prediction) had been trading near its 52-week low in early January 2026, as investors…\n\nLive Updates Amazon Shares Down 14% After Earnings - Is the Market Overreacting?

        "content": "Big Tech keeps raising its spending plans for artificial intelligence infrastructure, yet shares of Nvidia Corp., one of the biggest beneficiaries of that flood of cash, have been largely stagnant for months.\n\nThe stock is up less than 1% since the beginning of the fourth quarter and has been largely range bound despite hitting a record high in late October. It’s also barely beating the S&P 500 Index to start 2026, a slowdown from Nvidia’s nearly 40% leap in 2025 following two consecutive years of triple-digit percentage gains.\n\nEven ballooning capital spending from Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc. — estimated to exceed $600 billion in 2026 — hasn’t been enough to meaningfully boost the stock amid increasing anxieties about returns on those investments.\n\n“There is perhaps growing concern that the ultimate revenue from AI will simply not keep up with the capex spend that’s been announced,” said JoAnne Feeney at Advisors Capital Management, adding that more spending now raises the probability that the market will reach satiation faster.  It’s “going to move up the date at which they pause and let the new compute be digested.”\n\nThe cyclical nature of the chip industry is baked into Nvidia’s valuation, which has compressed as revenue growth is expected to slow in the coming years. Sales are projected to expand 58% in the current calendar year and 28% in 2027, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nNvidia shares trade around 24 times profit estimates, roughly in-line with the Nasdaq 100 index and a slight premium to the S&P 500. Even though this price-to-earnings ratio is far below the five-year average for the stock at 38 times, investors aren’t counting it as a discount.\n\nValuations for infrastructure providers like Nvidia are likely to move lower as growth in capital spending decelerates, according to UBS strategists led by Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi.\n\n“Capex growth is likely to moderate from these levels, which could improve investor perceptions of those doing the spending, but is a potential negative for some companies in the enabling layer,” they wrote in a note dated Feb. 10.\n\nThe next catalyst for Nvidia shares is its upcoming earnings report, due Feb. 25 after markets close. Investors will be focused on Nvidia’s guidance and demand for chips, which have accounted for a large chunk of hyperscaler spending in recent years.\n\n“It really does just come down to the valuation and how rich the company already is,” said Shelby McFaddin, an investment analyst at Motley Fool Asset Management. Investors want to “wait a second and actually see what Nvidia has to say about it before we reward them.”\n\nWall Street analyst estimates for Nvidia’s revenue and earnings in 2026 have barely budged since the tech giants revealed their mega-spending plans. Of course, analysts are likely waiting to hear from Nvidia before making changes to their models.\n\nAfter a big stock run up like Nvidia has had, it’s natural for there to be a period of consolidation, but sentiment can change rapidly, said Jim Thorne, chief market strategist at Wellington-Altus.\n\n“It’s psychology,” Thorne said. “All of a sudden everybody believes the story and the stock goes crazy up.”\n\n–With assistance from Eric J. Weiner and Matt Turner.\n\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com"

        "content": "Meta has focused on artificial intelligence in recent times.\n\nMeta Platforms (META 1.54%) is one of the Magnificent Seven tech stocks that have led S&P 500 gains over the past few years. These players have many things in common, from well-established businesses and leadership in their markets to strong earnings track records.\n\nBut there's one thing that separates Meta from the rest of these players. The company is the only one that hasn't yet launched and completed a stock split. Could this social media and artificial intelligence (AI) giant shift gears and announce such a move in 2026? Let's find out.\n\nSo, first, let's consider why companies perform stock splits. These operations often come after a stock has climbed significantly, touching a level that's beyond reach for some investors. A stock split doesn't change anything fundamental about a company or its stock, but it lowers the price of each individual share, opening up the investment opportunity to a broader range of people. (Though fractional shares offer investors an easy way to get in on stocks with a high price tag, they aren't available through every brokerage.)\n\nIn a stock split, a company offers current shareholders additional shares, determined by the ratio of the split, but the total value of their holdings remains the same after the operation. So, if the value of your one share was $1,000 prior to the split, your multiple shares after the split together would be worth $1,000.\n\nAnd speaking of $1,000, as a stock approaches that price, companies often consider executing a stock split, as this level represents a psychological barrier for some investors. They may view the stock as expensive even if valuation metrics show that it isn't.\n\nNow, let's consider whether Meta may opt for a stock split in the near future. The stock has advanced more than 200% over the past three years, but it's slipped from its highs. Over the past year, it's lost more than 6%.\n\nToday, Meta stock trades for about $670, down from a peak of more than $750 last year.\n\nWhile this level could discourage some investors from buying, it has been higher -- so price may not be a motive for a split right now. It's also important to note that Meta's focus in recent quarters has been on building up its AI presence and investing in infrastructure to expand its AI capabilities. So organizing a stock split at the moment may not be the priority.\n\nAll of this means I wouldn't expect Meta to plan such an operation today, but this doesn't mean it's off the table for 2026. It's key to keep a close eye on Meta's stock price this year. If it gains momentum and climbs quickly, this Magnificent Seven player may decide to join its peers and launch a stock split.\n\n*Average returns of all recommendations since inception.
