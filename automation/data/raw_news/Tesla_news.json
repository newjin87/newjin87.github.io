        "content": "The data doesn't lie: Wall Street has thrived with President Donald Trump in the White House.\n\nAlthough a rising stock market is relatively normal, regardless of the political party in power, aggregate stock returns under Trump have been above average. During his first non-consecutive term, the widely followed Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI), benchmark S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), and innovation-inspired Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) soared by 57%, 70%, and 142%, respectively.\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\n\nThese outsize returns have continued in President Trump's second term. Since his inauguration on Jan. 20, 2025, the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite have respectively rallied by 14%, 14%, and 15%.\n\nBut as Wall Street's major stock indexes have ascended to new heights, so have the potential headwinds threatening to pull the rug out from beneath this supercharged bull market. The question on most investors' minds is: Will a stock market crash take place in 2026 under Donald Trump? While no one can definitively answer this question, a few time-tested data points have clued investors in on what they can likely expect in the not-too-distant future.\n\nAlthough back-tested data sets and correlated events can't guarantee what's to come, they do help remove emotion from the equation, thereby allowing investors to view the stock market objectively. Two data-driven events, in particular, point to an increased likelihood that the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite will endure significant declines in 2026.\n\nTo begin with, the S&P 500's Shiller Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio is nearing uncharted territory. The Shiller P/E, also referred to as the Cyclically Adjusted P/E Ratio, or CAPE Ratio, is based on average inflation-adjusted earnings over the prior 10 years. Incorporating a decade of earnings history into its calculation ensures that recessions and shock events can't render this valuation tool useless.\n\nThough the Shiller P/E wasn't introduced until the late 1980s, it's been back-tested to January 1871. Over this 155-year period, the CAPE Ratio has averaged approximately 17.3. But for the last three months, it's vacillated between 39 and 41. The only time the Shiller P/E has been higher than it is now is in the lead-up to the bursting of the dot-com bubble.\n\nThe Shiller P/E isn't particularly helpful in identifying when corrections will begin. However, the five previous occurrences spanning 155 years in which it exceeded 30 during a continuous bull market were eventually followed by declines of 20% or greater in the Dow, S&P 500, and/or Nasdaq Composite. What the CAPE Ratio conclusively shows is that extended valuation premiums aren't tolerated over long periods on Wall Street. This is one of the stock market's red flags -- and the data doesn't lie.\n\nThe other potentially worrisome data-driven event is the upcoming midterm elections in November.\n\nPresident Trump began his second term with a unified government -- Republicans hold majorities in the House and Senate. However, the party of a sitting president frequently loses seats in one or both houses of Congress during midterm elections. With the GOP holding a slim majority in the House, it wouldn't take much of a shift in voting to create a split Congress. A divided Congress would likely eliminate the president's chance of signing any additional major legislation during his second term.\n\nAccording to data collected by Carson Investment Research and published on X (formerly Twitter) by Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick, stock market corrections tend to be larger during midterm years than any other year of a president's term.\n\nSince 1950, the average peak-to-trough downturn during midterm years in the S&P 500 has been 17.5% (i.e., within striking distance of a bear market). What's more, the S&P 500 fell nearly 20% during midterms in President Trump's first term.\n\nThe data demonstrates that Wall Street dislikes pricey stock markets and fiscal uncertainty. While both of these time-tested data sets point to a heightened likelihood of a stock market correction or perhaps even a bear market in 2026, neither indicates that a stock market crash is imminent or even brewing. Since history tends to rhyme on Wall Street, investors should expect a pullback in stocks at some point, but shouldn't be overly concerned with rumblings of a stock market crash.\n\nWhile decades, if not more than a century, of data point to potential stock market weakness in 2026, history offers an entirely different outlook for investors focused on the horizon.\n\nOn the one hand, stock market corrections, bear markets, and those pesky elevator-down moves that pull on investors' heartstrings are normal and inevitable events. Since stock market downturns are often driven, in part, by emotion, there's nothing the federal government or Federal Reserve can do to avoid this part of the investing cycle.\n\nBut what history teaches is that stock market cycles aren't mirror images of each other. Despite corrections, bear markets, and crashes being inevitable and representing the price of admission to the world's greatest wealth creator, bull markets and periods of optimism last substantially longer.\n\nLess than two weeks ago, analysts at Bespoke Investment Group refreshed a data set that examined the length of every S&P 500 bull and bear market, dating back to the beginning of the Great Depression (September 1929).\n\nAmong the 27 bear markets that have occurred over the last 96 years, just a third have reached the one-year mark, with none surpassing 630 calendar days. Further, the average bear market has hit its trough after 286 calendar days, or approximately 9.5 months. In other words, when significant downturns do occur, they tend to resolve quickly -- especially during stock market crashes.\n\nIn comparison, 10 S&P 500 bull markets, including the current one, have lasted longer than 1,200 calendar days. The typical bull market climb has endured for 1,011 calendar days, which is roughly 3.5 times longer than the average bear market.\n\nEven without knowing when stock market corrections will begin or how steep the decline will be, nearly a century of data conclusively shows that maintaining optimism and being patient is the formula for growing your wealth on Wall Street.\n\nBefore you buy stock in S&P 500 Index, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and S&P 500 Index wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Businesses face a new wave of uncertainty after the Supreme Court struck down tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump under an emergency powers law and Trump vowed to work around the ruling to keep his tariffs in place.\n\nThe Trump administration says its tariffs help boost American manufacturers and reduce the trade gap. But many U.S. businesses have had to raise prices and adjust in other ways to offset higher costs spurred by the tariffs.\n\nIt remains to be seen how much relief businesses and consumers will actually get from Friday's ruling. Within hours of the court's decision, Trump pledged to use a different law to impose a 10% tariff on all imports that would last 150 days, and to explore other ways to impose additional tariffs on countries he says engage in unfair trade practices.\n\n“Any boost to the economy from lowering tariffs in the near-term is likely to be partly offset by a prolonged period of uncertainty,” said Michael Pearce, an economist at Oxford Economics. “With the administration likely to rebuild tariffs through other, more durable, means, the overall tariffs rate may yet end up settling close to current levels.”\n\nEfforts to claw back the estimated $133 billion to $175 billion of previously collected tariffs now deemed illegal are bound to be complicated, and will likely favor larger companies with more resources. Consumers hoping for a refund are unlikely to be compensated.\n\nWith Trump’s unyielding position on tariffs, many businesses are braced for years of court battles.\n\nBasic Fun, a Florida-based maker of toys such as Lincoln Logs and Tonka trucks, last week joined a slew of other businesses in a lawsuit seeking to claw back tariffs paid to the government.\n\nWhile company CEO Jay Foreman is concerned about any new tariffs Trump may impose, he doesn’t think they will affect toys. Still, he said, “I do worry about some type of perpetual fight over this, at least for the next three years.”\n\nThe new 10% tariff Trump announced Friday immediately raised questions for Daniel Posner, the owner of Grapes The Wine Co., in White Plains, New York. Since wine shipments take about two weeks to cross the Atlantic, he wonders if he had a shipment arriving Monday, would it be subject to a 10% tariff?\n\n“We’re reactive to what’s become a very unstable situation,” Posner said.\n\nRon Kurnik owns Superior Coffee Roasting Co. in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, across the border from Canada. In addition to U.S. tariffs, Kurnik faced retaliatory tariffs from Canada for much of last year when he exported his coffee.\n\n“It’s like a nightmare we just want to wake up from,” said Kurnik, whose company has raised prices by 6% twice since the tariffs went into effect. While he’s pleased with the Supreme Court’s ruling, he doesn’t think he will ever see a refund.\n\nA wide array of industries, including retail, tech and the agricultural sector, used the Supreme Court ruling as an opportunity to remind Trump of how his trade policies have affected their businesses.\n\nThe Business Roundtable, a group that lobbies on behalf of more than 200 U.S. companies, released a statement encouraging the administration to limit the focus of tariffs going forward to specific unfair trade practices and national security concerns.\n\nIn the retail industry, stores of all stripes have embraced different ways to offset the effects of tariffs — from absorbing some of the costs themselves, to cutting expenses and diversifying their supply network. Still, they have had to pass on some price increases at a time when shoppers have been particularly sensitive to inflationary pressures.\n\nDave French, executive vice president of government relations for The National Retail Federation, the nation’s largest retail industry trade group, said he hoped lower courts would ensure “a seamless process” to refund tariffs. That issue wasn't addressed in Friday's ruling.\n\nFor the technology sector, Trump’s tariffs caused major headaches. Many of its products are either built overseas or depend on imports of key components. The Computer & Communications Industry Association, which represents a spectrum of technology companies employing more than 1.6 million people, expressed hope that the decision will ease the trade tensions.\n\n\"With this decision behind us, we look forward to bringing more stability to trade policy,” said Jonathan McHale, the association’s vice president for digital trade.\n\nFarmers, who have been stung by higher prices for equipment and fertilizer since the tariffs went into effect, and reduced demand for their exports, also spoke out.\n\n“We strongly encourage the president to avoid using any other available authorities to impose tariffs on agricultural inputs that would further increase costs,” said American Farm Bureau Federation President Zippy Duvall.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled 6-3 that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act did not give the president authority to tax imports, a power that belongs to Congress. But the decision only affects tariffs imposed under that law, so some industries will see no relief at all.\n\nThe decision leaves in effect tariffs on steel, upholstered furniture, kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, according to the Home Furnishings Association, which represents 15,000 furniture stores in North America.\n\nAt Revolution Brewing in Chicago, the aluminum they use for cans costs as much as the ingredients that go inside them because of tariffs Trump has placed on metals that are not affected by the Supreme Court ruling. While the cans are made in Chicago, the aluminum comes from Canada, said Josh Deth, managing partner at the brewery.\n\nTariffs have been just one challenge for his business, which is also affected by volatile barley prices and a slowdown in demand for craft beer.\n\n“Everything kind of adds up,” he said. “The beverage industry needs relief here. We’re getting crushed by the prices of aluminum.”\n\nItalian winemakers hard-hit by the tariffs greeted the Supreme Court decision with skepticism, warning that the decision may just deepen uncertainty around trade with the U.S.\n\nThe U.S. is Italy’s largest wine market, with sales having tripled in value over the past 20 years. New tariffs on the EU, which the Trump administration initially threatened would be 200%, had sent fear throughout the industry, which remained even after the U.S. reduced, delayed and negotiated down.\n\n“There is a more than likely risk that tariffs will be reimposed through alternative legal channels, compounded by the uncertainty this ruling may generate in commercial relations between Europe and the United States,” said Lamberto Frescobaldi, president of UIV, a trade association that represents more than 800 winemakers.\n\nElsewhere in Europe, initial reaction focused on renewed upheaval and confusion regarding costs facing businesses exporting to the US.\n\nTrump's tariffs could hit pharmaceuticals, chemicals and auto parts, said Carsten Brzeski, an economist at ING bank. “Europe should not be mistaken, this ruling will not bring relief,\" he said. \"The legal authority may be different, but the economic impact could be identical or worse.”\n\nAnne D'Innocenzio in New York; Dee-Ann Durbin in Detroit; Michael Liedtke in San Francisco; David McHugh in Frankfurt, Germany; Jonathan Matisse in Nashville, Tennessee; Adrian Sainz in Memphis, Tennessee; and Nicole Winfield in Rome contributed to this report."

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Gold advanced as the dollar slid, with investors weighing the White House’s next steps on tariffs after the US Supreme Court struck down President Donald Trump’s sweeping global tariffs.\n\nThe Supreme Court said Trump exceeded his authority by invoking a federal emergency powers law to impose his “reciprocal” tariffs across the globe as well as targeted import taxes. The ruling invalidates a large portion of the tariffs that Trump has rolled out in his second term. The ruling implied that the US Treasury may need to refund levies paid by importers and reduce future revenues, according to Bart Melek, global head of commodity strategy.\n\nPrivate Prisons Face an Existential Threat Under Trump's New Detention Plan\n\nA Shaker Revival Points to Something Deeper Than a Trad Obsession\n\nWhite House Ballroom Design Approved by Trump Commission After One Hearing\n\n“This should stress the budget, increasing speculation that monetary tools may need to be used to fund government, he said. “This is accretive for gold” as the possible measures will likely keep rates low. Bullion typically performs well in a low rate environment as it doesn’t pay interest.\n\nThe dollar fell as much as 0.3%, lifting gold as much as 1.6% as the precious metal is priced in the greenback.\n\n“The market is recognizing that this is going to be a very messy legal battle for years,” said Ben McMillan of IDX Advisors, noting that the Supreme Court decision didn’t specify details around tariff refunds. “They’re pushing all of that to the lower courts. What that means is it’s gonna be a lot of individual lawsuits.”\n\nTrump said in a Friday press conference that alternatives will be used to replace rejected tariffs. While the US Constitution gives Congress the power to levy taxes and duties, lawmakers have delegated some authority to the executive branch through a number of statutes.\n\nTrump said he would impose a 10% global tariff under Section 122, over and above tariffs already being charged. He declared all national security tariffs under Section 232 and existing Section 301 tariffs to be in full force and effect.\n\nBullion wavered earlier Friday after Russia said its central bank sold gold from its reserves in January, the first decrease in since October. Central bank buying has played a crucial role in gold’s rally for the past three years, providing a strong floor to prices. With 300,000 ounces of bullion now available in the open market, it raised concerns that gold may face some near-term weakness on top of heightened volatility following a historic price plunge at the end of January.\n\nStill the factors that underpinned gold’s earlier advance to above $5,500 an ounce remain largely intact, including a wider move away from sovereign bonds and currencies, as well as geopolitical risks. The latest US moves on Iran are adding to global uncertainties, increasing the appeal for haven assets such as gold.\n\nThe US military is stationing a vast array of forces in the Middle East, with Trump saying that Iran had 10 to 15 days at most to strike a deal over its nuclear program. A major US strike against the Islamic Republic, where leaders are anxious about regime stability after widespread unrest, would risk entangling Washington in a third war of choice in the region since 1991.\n\nBanks including BNP Paribas SA and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. have said they expect prices to resume their upward trend. Central banks, a major driver of gold’s rally, remain keen to build up holdings as a hedge against geopolitical and financial risks, Goldman analysts Lina Thomas and Daan Struyven said in a note. That’s despite elevated volatility that weighed on buying in December.\n\nSpot gold gained  to $ an ounce at  in New York. In other metals, silver added , while platinum and palladium both advanced.

The company has been benefiting from strong pricing power and an expanding smoke-free portfolio. Philip Morris has been making significant progress with the smoke-free transition, with products like IQOS and ZYN contributing to strong performance and margin expansion. In the fourth quarter of 2025, Philip Morris' net revenues increased 6.8% year over year, driven by higher combustible tobacco pricing and increased smoke-free product volumes. Smoke-free products accounted for about 43% of total gross profit in full-year 2025. The company is also advancing cost-saving initiatives to support long-term goals. For 2026, adjusted earnings per share are likely to be $8.38-$8.53, up 11.1%-13.1% year-over-year. However, Philip Morris faces premium valuation, ongoing global cigarette volume declines and rising regulatory pressure.(You can read the full research report on Philip Morris here >>>)Shares of Lockheed Martin have outperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry over the past six months (+51.3% vs. +14.6%). The company’s broad product offerings allow it to secure major defense contracts, which in turn boosts its backlog count. Lockheed Martin remains the largest U.S. defense contractor with a steady order flow from the Pentagon and other U.S. allies. Apart from enjoying a strong forte on the domestic front, Lockheed Martin’s products are also well-acclaimed in the international market. Increasing U.S. defense budget funding should boost its business. However, Lockheed is facing performance issues with some of its programs, which may result in significant losses.

The company’s strong momentum in bioprocessing, fueled by rising demand for consumables from pharmaceutical customers, is driving growth in the Biotechnology unit. Strength in the clinical diagnostics businesses bodes well for the Diagnostics segment. Danaher’s commitment to return value to its shareholders is encouraging. Benefits from acquired assets are driving the company’s performance of late. Through Danaher’s DBS initiatives, it has been able to reduce the impact of supply-chain constraints and inflationary pressures. However, the company is plagued by weakness in the Life Sciences segment. An increase in SG&A expenses may affect the margin performance. High debt levels may raise the company’s financial obligations and drain its profitability. Also, forex woes are weighing on Danaher's top line.(You can read the full research report on Danaher here >>>)Shares of Zeo Energy have underperformed the Zacks Alternative Energy - Other industry over the past six months (-49.4% vs. +23.7%). This microcap company with a market capitalization of $56.82 million is facing risks, including credit losses and receivable exposure, related-party concentration and guarantees, amortization tied to acquired contracts, preferred securities increasing capital costs, seasonal installation volatility and ongoing share dilution that may cap per-share upside.Nevertheless, Zeo Energy is entering an earnings inflection as improved pricing discipline and lower revenue costs drive margin expansion and positive EBITDA, establishing a higher operating baseline. Stronger unit economics enhance operating leverage and internal cash generation. The Heliogen acquisition expands the platform into commercial and industrial solar and storage, adding exposure to data center and grid demand while diversifying beyond residential.
