> US stocks rose on Friday after the Supreme Court ruled that President Trump's most sweeping "Liberation Day" tariffs are unlawful, saying he lacked the authority to impose them using emergency powers.
> The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose almost 0.7%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained roughly 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led gains, up nearly 0.9%. All three major averages posted weekly gains.
> Stocks reversed course on the heels of the decision as investors kept an eye out for US-Iran tensions and private credit jitters.
> The Supreme Court ruled on Friday morning that Trump overstepped his powers in invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose tariffs on several trading partners in April.
> In response, President Trump said in a press conference that his administration will be placing a "10% global tariff" to replace the duties struck down by the high court.

> Wall Street learned earlier Friday that US GDP grew more slowly than expected in the fourth quarter, coming in at 1.4%, far behind forecasts. Meanwhile, the "core" personal expenditures index — Fed rate-setters' preferred gauge of inflation — rose more than expected in December, on a monthly and annual basis.
> The watch is on for signs of stress in the private credit sector, after Blue Owl's (OBDC, OWL) halt to withdrawals. Fears are the move is a "canary in the coal mine" financial crisis-style moment amid concerns about the sector's holdings of software stocks threatened by AI.
> Stocks rose on Friday after the Supreme Court ruled that President Trump's emergency tariff policy was unlawful.
> The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose almost 0.7% to close out the week with gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained roughly 0.4% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped nearly 0.9%.
> President Trump on Friday afternoon announced a 10% global tariff in response to the levies that the high court struck down earlier that day.
> Investors will turn their focus to Nvidia (NVDA) earnings next Wednesday. The chip heavyweight is seen as the bellwether of the AI industry.
> Investors will turn their focus to Nvidia (NVDA) earnings next week. The AI chip heavyweight is seen as the bellwether of the AI industry.
> Nvidia shares are up nearly 2% year to date as investors have broadly rotated out of tech into more cyclical and defensive sectors.
> The company will report earnings next Wednesday after the market closes. Investors will be paying close attention to CEO Jensen Huang's commentary on data center growth, demand for its Blackwell and Rubin chips, and any discussion of China export controls.
> Cybersecurity software stocks fell on Friday after Anthropic announced a new security capability for its Claude AI model, resurfacing concerns of sector-wide disruption.
> CrowdStrike (CRWD) dropped 5%, while Zscaler (ZS) also fell about 3%. Meanwhile, Cloudflare (NET) shares decreased 6%.
> Anthropic said the new feature, available in a limited research preview, “scans codebases for security vulnerabilities and suggests targeted software patches for human review, allowing teams to find and fix security issues that traditional methods often miss.”
> Wall Street has been pushing back against the sell-off, which started in software and expanded into cybersecurity, wealth management, and even logistics in recent weeks. Investors fear AI will impact margins as customers turn to AI solutions and the barrier to entry for startups decreases.
> President Trump said in a press briefing on Friday that his administration will be placing a "10% global tariff ... over and above the normal tariffs already being charged" now that the Supreme Court has struck down his wide-sweeping tariff regime.
> In a 6-3 vote on Friday, the Supreme Court ruled that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not give the president the authority to levy tariffs, dealing a blow to the Trump administration's signature economic policy.
> The high court's ruling, Trump said at the briefing, was "deeply disappointing."
> In those tariffs' place, which the president claimed authority under IEEPA to implement, a global tariff authorized under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 will now be put in place, and the administration will be starting several trade investigations under Section 301.
> The White House, Trump said, is ready to replace his tariff regime, struck down by the Supreme Court, with "methods, statutes, practices, and authorities" recognized by the court system and Congress that "are even stronger than IEEPA tariffs."
> The alternative measures the administration will now put in place to replace the tariffs will "actually increase" the amount of money coming into the country, based on the court's decision, Trump said at the briefing.
> The president also mentioned that "all national security tariffs" under Section 232 and Section 301 "remain fully in place and in full force and effect."
> The Supreme Court's ruling on Friday leaves tariffs implemented under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 — which cite national-security concerns — unchanged, keeping in place a range of import duties on products ranging from copper and semiconductors to automobiles and wood products such as cabinetry.
> Section 232 tariffs include 50% levies on imports of semi-finished copper products, 25% levies on certain imported semiconductors — including Nvidia's (NVDA) H200 chips — and automobile tariffs, including 25% levies on trucks and 10% levies on buses.
> Furniture and cookware stocks are getting a boost following the highly anticipated Supreme Court ruling against President Trump's authority to issue tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).
> Bob's Discount Furniture (BOBS), which listed on the NYSE Feb. 5, was up as much as 5%. Wayfair (W), Arhaus (ARHS), and Williams-Sonoma Inc. (WSM) also made gains.
> In an interview with Yahoo Finance two weeks ago, Bob's Discount Furniture president and CEO Bill Barton called 2025 "a challenging year with tariffs."
> He added, "We don't sell any third-party brands; everything we sell is made for us. We have deep long-standing relationships with our manufacturing partners ... through those relationships, we were able to renegotiate costs, to get costs down to offset a lot of the tariffs."
> Like many retailers, Barton said the team moved countries and factories to reduce costs and, as a last resort, the company raised prices for consumers.
> The National Retail Federation said in a statement that this provides "much-needed certainty" for businesses and manufacturers alike.
> "Clear and consistent trade policy is essential for economic growth, creating jobs and opportunities for American families. We urge the lower court to ensure a seamless process to refund the tariffs to US importers. The refunds will serve as an economic boost and allow companies to reinvest in their operations, their employees and their customers," the release said.
> As our Ben Werschkul reported, though, there is still some lingering uncertainty around the future of Trump's tariff policy, as well as the possibility of refunds for these companies.
> The US Supreme Court's ruling on Friday that struck down President Trump's widespread tariff regime is bullish for the tech industry, Wedbush Securities managing director Dan Ives said in a client note after the ruling was announced.
> In a 6-3 vote released Friday morning, the US Supreme Court ruled that a 1977 national security law does not give the president authority to levy tariffs. Citing the more than $100 billion in potential tariff revenue refunds, the reversal could lead to a stronger financial outlook for the tech sector.
> "We believe this would act as a net positive for tech with financial relief for many companies while creating greater supply chain visibility, especially coming from the Asia supply chain," Ives wrote on Friday.
> Of note, the Supreme Court's Friday ruling, which struck down the president's authority to levy tariffs under the IEEPA law, did not affect tariffs imposed on national security grounds under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. Those tariffs include 50% levies on imports of semi-finished copper products, 25% levies on certain imported semiconductors — including Nvidia's (NVDA) H200 chips.
> "This will be a very noisy situation, but for the tech space and AI trade, it's a net positive out of the gates in our view," Ives wrote.
> The Dow Jones Transportation Average (^DJT) jumped to a five-day high on the SCOTUS/tariffs news, topping out around 1.7% before giving back many of those gains.
> At the highs, the index had retraced last week’s AI scare trade drop of roughly 4%.
> Participation is broad across rails and carriers: Union Pacific (UNP), CSX (CSX), Norfolk Southern (NSC); FedEx (FDX), UPS (UPS); Delta (DAL), United (UAL), American (AAL); plus logistics names like Old Dominion (ODFL), Expeditors (EXPD), XPO (XPO), and C.H. Robinson (CHRW).
> Southwest (LUV) and Alaska Air (ALK) are notable laggards.
> As long as the Dow Transports can stick near the top of today’s range, the post-ruling relief bid looks sticky. A full fade back below the morning pop would put last week’s drawdown back in play.
> CoreWeave (CRWV) stock fell as much as 9% early Friday after a report from Business Insider suggested lenders are worried about the company's creditworthiness.
> Blue Owl (OWL) has spent most of the time in the headlines this week over its decision to halt redemptions from a private credit fund (the company will instead return capital to shareholders on its own terms). Overall, the firm has continued to serve as the poster child of any worried about private credit in the market.
> But the CoreWeave story — along with Oracle (ORCL) — will also remain a key canary on any fears investors have about the durability or reliability of the AI data center build-out .
> With most of the focus on tariffs on Friday, a drop worth noting with Nvidia (NVDA) earnings up next week.
> Apparel names are catching a bid this morning after the Supreme Court struck down President Trump’s IEEPA tariffs — a broadly bullish initial read-through for import-heavy retailers.
> Nike (NKE) popped immediately on the headline — up about 4.4% at the highs — but has given back most of the gains. Under Armour (UAA), Levi Strauss (LEVI), Deckers Outdoor (DECK), and Kontoor Brands (KTB) saw similar knee-jerk lifts and retreats, to varying degrees.
> Even European brands like Adidas (ADS.DE, ADDYY) got pulled in.
> Speaking of European brands, a scan of the high-end luxury sector also reveals broad strength — Tapestry (TPR), LVMH (MC.PA, LVMUY), Hermès (RMS.PA, HESAY), Richemont (CFR.SW, CFRUY), Burberry (BRBY.L, BURBY).
> The closing print today will be critical to judge if this is a lasting tailwind trade.
> The Supreme Court's tariff ruling on Friday, which overturned President Trump's vast tariff regime instituted under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), does not affect other "Section 232" tariffs implemented through his second term on products ranging from metals and lumber to cars.
> In a 6-3 vote released Friday morning, the US Supreme Court ruled that IEEPA does not give the president authority to levy tariffs, dealing a major blow to what has become the signature tool of the Trump administration's foreign policy dealmaking.
> The ruling, however, leaves tariffs implemented under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 — which cite national-security concerns — unchanged, keeping in place a ream of import duties on products ranging from copper and semiconductors to automobiles and wood products such as cabinetry.
> Section 232 tariffs include 50% levies on imports of semi-finished copper products, 25% levies on certain imported semiconductors — including Nvidia's (NVDA) H200 chips — and automobile tariffs, including 25% levies on trucks and 10% levies on buses.
> The administration has also proposed 100% tariffs on specific pharmaceutical products, which, if implemented, would be done so under Section 232.
> The metals market saw only a slight reaction in the minutes after the ruling. Futures on copper (HG=F) rose by roughly 1.1%, while aluminum (ALI=F) ticked up by 0.6%. Elsewhere in the industrial sector, lumber (LBR=F) futures fell by roughly 0.4% on Friday as traders priced in cheaper import prices.
> Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) is the green-shoots standout in megacap stocks Friday morning, up over 2.5%.
> It's on pace for its best day in nearly three months, after a negative stretch where it was down six of the last seven sessions.
> The tape is catching the eyes of swing traders, given GOOGL opened above its five-day moving average after spending the prior 11 days trapped underneath it. Many punters — like Brian Shannon of AlphaTrends — will wait until a stock has climbed over its five-day moving average before buying (alongside other criteria, which vary from trader to trader).
> There's not a clean company headline driving the pop, though the news of the Supreme Court striking down President Trump's tariffs is providing broad strength to US stocks.
> Meanwhile, on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid this morning, Winthrop Capital chief investment officer Adam Coons was talking up the search giant, saying, "[Alphabet] is backed by real earnings … real revenue growth … really strong margins.”
> For many traders, as long as GOOGL holds above the five-day, the bounce is intact.
> Refunds on President Trump's widespread tariff scheme could cost the US as much as $175 billion, according to new estimates from Penn-Wharton Budget Model economists.
> Reuters first reported the new estimate.
> On Friday morning, the Supreme Court on Friday ruled in a 6-3 vote that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not give the president the authority to levy tariffs, dealing a blow to the Trump administration's signature economic policy and setting up a bevy of questions over what a reversal of the foreign policy will look like.
> Now that the president's tariff scheme has been struck down, importers are likely to begin scrambling to claim refunds from US Customs and Border Protection on import duties paid throughout the year.
> The White House has previously said that if the Supreme Court were to strike down Trump's IEEPA tariffs, the administration would replicate them through other policies that could mirror their effects.
> However, the replacement measures the White House will have at its disposal could be more limited in scope and slower to enact, according to Bloomberg.
> The Supreme Court on Friday ruled in a 6-3 decision that President Trump does not have the authority to levy a broad swath of tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).
> But the initial reaction from some on Wall Street is that this legal defeat is unlikely to mark the end of the administration's push to use tariffs to achieve its economic goals, primarily that of lowering our trade deficit and onshoring US manufacturing.
> "I don't think we have heard the last from Trump and tariffs," wrote Neil Dutta, head of economics at Renaissance Macro. There is a vast legal architecture that Trump can draw from to prosecute this... The issue is if he does not dial the tariff threat back on, he basically looks like a lame duck. The issue is more political than economic, at least right now. If Trump turns the trade knob back on, we get more uncertainty. If he decides to give in, then he is basically cooked politically."
> In a separate note, Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS, wrote, "The headline shock for markets, even if largely expected since the November 2025 Supreme Court arguments, is likely to fade in the trading days to follow."
> "It is important to realize that the import tariffs are only bringing in about $250 billion a year more than they did in the Biden administration," Rupkey added. "A $250 billion loss of revenue is not make or break for getting the country’s $7 trillion in Federal government spending under control, nor is it in any way fixing the fiscal year 2025 $1.7 trillion Federal budget deficit."
> The Supreme Court on Friday ruled in a 6-3 vote that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not give the president the authority to levy tariffs, dealing a blow to the Trump dministration's signature economic policy.
> Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, Neil Gorsuch, Amy Coney Barrett, and Ketanji Brown Jackson voted in the majority.
> Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Brett Kavanaugh formed the dissent.
> Throughout his second term, Trump has leaned on the IEEPA to grant him broad authority to set tariff policy as he saw fit, beginning with the April 2025 "Liberation Day" announcement of tariffs on a slew of allies and other countries. That announcement sent the markets careening downward before a recovery later in the year.
> It remains to be seen exactly how the Supreme Court's decision will impact the tariffs the president has already imposed. The market's initial reaction to Friday's ruling was muted.
> The US dollar (DX-Y.NYB) is at its highest level in nearly a month following a rally over the past two weeks, a typically bearish signal for stocks. Even so, readings on the US economy's direction give investors a broad range of opportunities in US equities, UBS strategists wrote in a client note Friday morning.
> Given the split in perspectives over where to take rates in the Fed's January meeting — the minutes were released on Wednesday — the Fed is likely to maintain its position and hold rates steady, said the UBS strategists, led by global wealth management CIO Mark Haefele.
> "While the minutes did not suggest officials were contemplating the possibility of rate increases, they made clear policymakers were in no rush to cut rates as 'the vast majority of participants judged that downside risks to employment had moderated in recent months while the risk of more persistent inflation remained,'" the UBS strategists wrote.
> Yet, despite the short-term hold on the horizon, the US central bank likely has "further to go its easing cycle, and this remains a key pillar in our positive outlook on US equities overall," the strategists wrote.
> "With the easing cycle still intact, and the US economy showing resilience amid an improvement in manufacturing activity and industrial output, we expect healthy and broadening profit growth across sectors," the strategists wrote, noting "attractive opportunities" in financials, health care, utilities, consumer discretionary, and industrials.
> The US stock market fell into the red on Friday as investors digested economic data that showed the US economy's growth slowed down in the fourth quarter, while so-called "core" PCE, the Fed's favored inflation gauge, heated up in December. The market is also watching tensions in the Middle East, nerves in the private credit market, and a potential tariff decision from the US Supreme Court.
> The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell by 0.2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slid into the red by 0.4% after a the end of a three-day winning streak on Thursday. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) turned down by 0.5% before paring losses to a slide of 0.2%.
> Prices rose by 0.4% in December over the previous month, according to Personal Consumption Expenditures index data, while the so-called "core" PCE, which excludes the more volatile food and energy categories, also rose 0.4% on the month, a step up from the previous month's 0.2% growth.
> New data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis on Friday showed the economy grew at an annualized rate of 1.4% in the final three months of 2025. Economists had expected GDP to grow at an annualized rate of 2.9% in the fourth quarter.
> I still think the strong earnings report out of Walmart (WMT) yesterday is a better proxy on the economy right now than a government GDP report.
> I got no indication (nor saw any in the earnings report) in my chat below with Walmart CFO John David Rainey the business has slowed at all:
> Prices rose by 0.4% in December over the previous month, marking an increase from the previous month, according to Personal Consumption Expenditures index data released Friday by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.
> The growth exceeded economists' expectations of 0.3%, according to Bloomberg's consensus estimates.
> So-called "core" PCE, which excludes the more volatile food and energy categories, also rose 0.4% on the month, a step up from the previous month's 0.2% growth. Economists had predicted that the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure would rise by 0.3%.
> On an annual basis, the headline and core PCE price indexes rose 2.9% and 3.0%, respectively, in December from the previous year, also slightly above economist estimates for the two gauges.
> Meanwhile, personal income remained consistent, rising 0.3% in December on a monthly basis, in line with the previous month's growth and matching economist expectations.
> Personal spending increased 0.4% from last month, coming in above expectations of 0.3% but falling below the previous month's growth of 0.5%.
> The US economy grew at a slower pace than expected in the fourth quarter of 2025.
> New data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis on Friday showed the economy grew at an annualized rate of 1.4% in the final three months of 2025. Economists had expected GDP to grow at an annualized rate of 2.9% in the fourth quarter.
> In a post on Truth Social ahead of the report, President Trump said the government shutdown that lasted 43 days back in the fall cost the US economy "at least two points in GDP." The president also again called for lower interest rates.
> In its release, the BEA said, "Compared to the third quarter, the deceleration in real GDP in the fourth quarter reflected downturns in government spending and exports and a deceleration in consumer spending that were partly offset by an acceleration in investment."
> Underlying spending trends, however, remained solid, with real final sales to private domestic purchasers — the sum of consumer spending and gross private fixed investment — increasing 2.4 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with an increase of 2.9 percent in the third quarter.
> Friday's report had been set for release on Jan. 29, but data collection was delayed by the shutdown that covered all of October and parts of November.

### 2. [US economy slowed sharply in the fourth quarter, expanding at a rate of just 1.4%](https://krdo.com/news/2026/02/20/us-economy-slowed-sharply-in-the-fourth-quarter-expanding-at-a-rate-of-just-1-4/)

> By Bryan Mena, Alicia Wallace, CNN
> Washington (CNN) — The US economy grew at a much slower pace in the final months of 2025 as the historic government shutdown weighed on economic activity, ending a year that saw the weakest growth since the pandemic.
> Still, it was far from the worst-case scenario economists feared when President Donald Trump unveiled his sweeping tariffs last spring. The economy grew in 2025, despite tariffs, an aggressive clampdown on immigration and one of the weakest stretches of job creation since the Great Recession, largely thanks to wealthy consumers who continued to spend.
> Gross domestic product, which measures all the goods and services produced in the economy, registered at an annualized rate of 1.4% from October through December, the Commerce Department said Friday. That’s a marked slowdown from the 4.4% rate in the third quarter, and lower than the 1.9% rate economists projected in a poll by data firm FactSet. GDP is adjusted for seasonal swings and inflation.
> Overall, the economy grew by 2.2% in 2025, the slowest pace since 2020.
> Stephanie Roth, chief economist at Wolfe Research, told CNN that last year’s slower growth, compared to prior years, was “great given how much labor supply is down.”
> “You could call it ‘Goldilocks,’” she said.
> How growth played out late last year
> The cuts in federal spending, due to the shutdown, shaved off 1.1 percentage points from growth last quarter, according to the report, with economists widely expecting most of those losses to be recouped early this year.
> Consumers pulling back slightly on goods purchases also took a toll on fourth-quarter GDP.
> The fourth-quarter reading was delayed a month because of last year’s government shutdown.
> Consumer spending, the lifeblood of the US economy, slowed in the fourth quarter to an annual rate of 1.4%, the weakest pace since early 2025. Over the past year, spending has been uneven by income bracket, with the poorest Americans buckling under the weight of rising debt, a slowing labor market and cumulative inflation over the past several years.
> “A slower pace of consumer spending was expected for the final quarter of 2025, as some Americans had just shelled out for a new car before electric vehicle tax credits expired,” said Brett Ryan, senior US economist at Deutsche Bank.
> However, Ryan expects that key economic engine will pick back up in the first part of this year, largely because of tax refunds, adding that there’s “certainly nothing that would get you too concerned about an imminent consumer slowdown.”
> The widening inequality in America has prompted households with fewer means to sour on the economy over the past year. In a separate report on Friday, the University of Michigan reported that consumer sentiment continued to diverge between those with college degrees and stock investments, and those without.
> “A sizable month-to-month increase in sentiment for the largest stockholders was fully offset by a decline among consumers without stock holdings,” Joanne Hsu, the survey’s director, said in a release. “Similar divergences were seen across income and education, where higher-income or college educated consumers exhibited increases in sentiment while lower-income or less-educated counterparts did not.”
> Meanwhile, business spending edged higher in the fourth quarter to 3.7% from the 3.2% in the prior three-month period. Ryan said that “AI spending is still definitely doing a lot of heavy lifting” on the business investment side.
> Income gains and savings slip while inflation picks up
> A separate Commerce Department report released Friday showed that consumer spending remained in the black during December; however, the supports propping up those purchases grew weaker; and inflation heated up to its highest rate in nearly two years.
> Consumer spending rose by 0.4% in December, but when factoring in inflation, that pace was just 0.1% from November, according to the shutdown-delayed report originally scheduled for January 29.
> Personal incomes rose 0.3% for the month, in part pushed higher by a substantial settlement made to Maui wildfire victims. When taking inflation into account, personal income growth was flat.
> Savings as a percentage of after-tax income dropped to 3.6%, its lowest rate since October 2022.
> Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge heated up to 2.9%, inching further away from the central bank’s 2% target. It’s the highest annual rate since March 2024.
> Goods-related price increases helped to drive the 0.4% monthly inflation gain, Commerce Department data shows. Trump’s slate of steep tariffs on imported goods have resulted in higher prices for certain products such as furniture, appliances and toys.
> When stripping out volatile energy and food prices, a closely watched measurement of underlying inflation trajectory rose to its highest rate in nearly a year. The core PCE price index rose by 0.4%, to an annual rate of 3%.

### 3. [EUR/USD holds ground as weak US GDP clashes with firm inflation data](https://www.fxstreet.com/news/eur-usd-holds-ground-as-weak-us-gdp-clashes-with-firm-inflation-data-202602201445)
**Source**: FXStreet | **Date**: 2026-02-20T14:45:00+00:00

> The Euro (EUR) trades little changed against the US Dollar (USD) on Friday as investors digest the latest batch of US economic data. At the time of writing, EUR/USD hovers near 1.1763, recovering modestly from an intraday low of 1.1743, but remains on track for a weekly loss.
> The pair struggles for clear direction as a weaker-than-expected US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for Q4 contrasts with firmer-than-anticipated Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation data.
> Advance estimates showed the US economy grew at an annualized rate of 1.4% in Q4 2025, slowing sharply from 4.4% in the previous quarter and missing the 3.0% consensus forecast. However, the GDP Price Index held steady at 3.7%.
> Meanwhile, inflation data reinforced the view that price pressure remains sticky. Core PCE, the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) preferred inflation gauge, rose 0.4% MoM in December, accelerating from 0.2% previously and beating expectations of 0.3%. On an annual basis, Core PCE climbed 3.0%, above the 2.8% prior reading and exceeding the 2.9% forecast.
> Headline PCE inflation also firmed in December. The PCE Price Index rose 0.4% MoM, accelerating from 0.2% in November and exceeding the 0.3% consensus. The annual rate ticked higher to 2.9% from 2.8%.
> The data briefly stirred short-term volatility in the US Dollar. The US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the Greenback’s value against a basket of six major currencies, is hovering around the 98.00 mark after dipping to an intraday low near 97.80.
> The soft growth print points to slowing economic momentum, while sticky inflation keeps the Fed’s cautious policy stance intact. Minutes from the Fed’s January monetary policy meeting, released earlier this week, showed policymakers remain concerned about persistent inflationary pressure, limiting the scope for near-term easing. Officials also noted that further rate hikes could be warranted if inflation fails to move sustainably toward the 2% target.
> However, the data did little to materially shift market expectations, with traders continuing to price in two rate cuts later this year. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, the first reduction in borrowing costs is still largely anticipated in June.
> Separately, preliminary S&P Global Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) data showed the Composite PMI edged down to 52.3 in February from 53.0 previously, while the Manufacturing PMI slipped to 51.2 from 52.4 and the Services PMI eased to 52.3 from 52.7.
> Traders now await the University of Michigan (UoM) Consumer Sentiment Index and inflation expectations data due later in the American session.
> Inflation measures the rise in the price of a representative basket of goods and services. Headline inflation is usually expressed as a percentage change on a month-on-month (MoM) and year-on-year (YoY) basis. Core inflation excludes more volatile elements such as food and fuel which can fluctuate because of geopolitical and seasonal factors. Core inflation is the figure economists focus on and is the level targeted by central banks, which are mandated to keep inflation at a manageable level, usually around 2%.
> The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures the change in prices of a basket of goods and services over a period of time. It is usually expressed as a percentage change on a month-on-month (MoM) and year-on-year (YoY) basis. Core CPI is the figure targeted by central banks as it excludes volatile food and fuel inputs. When Core CPI rises above 2% it usually results in higher interest rates and vice versa when it falls below 2%. Since higher interest rates are positive for a currency, higher inflation usually results in a stronger currency. The opposite is true when inflation falls.
> Although it may seem counter-intuitive, high inflation in a country pushes up the value of its currency and vice versa for lower inflation. This is because the central bank will normally raise interest rates to combat the higher inflation, which attract more global capital inflows from investors looking for a lucrative place to park their money.
> Formerly, Gold was the asset investors turned to in times of high inflation because it preserved its value, and whilst investors will often still buy Gold for its safe-haven properties in times of extreme market turmoil, this is not the case most of the time. This is because when inflation is high, central banks will put up interest rates to combat it.
> Higher interest rates are negative for Gold because they increase the opportunity-cost of holding Gold vis-a-vis an interest-bearing asset or placing the money in a cash deposit account. On the flipside, lower inflation tends to be positive for Gold as it brings interest rates down, making the bright metal a more viable investment alternative.
> I am a macro-focused research analyst with over four years of experience covering forex and commodities market. I enjoy breaking down complex economic trends and turning them into clear, actionable insights that help traders stay ahead of the curve.
> EUR/USD now loses some upside momentum, returning to the area below the 1.1800 support as the Greenback manages to regain some composure following the SCOTUS-led pullback earlier in the session.
> Following earlier highs north of 1.3500 the figure, GBP/USD now faces some renewed downside pressure, revisiting the 1.3490 zone as the US Dollar manages to regain some upside impulse in the latter part of the NA session on Friday.
> Gold keeps the bid tone well in place at the end of the week, now hitting fresh weekly highs and retargeting the key $5,100 mark per troy ounce. The move higher in the yellow metal comes in response to ongoing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and modest losses in the US Dollar.
> Bitcoin rises marginally, nearing the immediate resistance of $68,000 at the time of writing on Friday. Major altcoins, including Ethereum and Ripple, hold key support levels as bulls aim to maintain marginal intraday gains.
> Dollar strength dominates markets as risk appetite remains subdued. A Supreme Court ruling, geopolitics and Fed developments are in focus. Pivotal Nvidia earnings on Wednesday as investors question tech sector weakness.
> XRP ticks up above $1.40 support, but waning retail demand suggests caution. XRP attracts $4 million in spot ETF inflows on Thursday, signaling renewed institutional investor interest.

### 4. [Stock market today: Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq futures falter as US-Iran tensions rise, PCE inflation looms](https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-today-dow-sp-500-nasdaq-futures-falter-as-us-iran-tensions-rise-pce-inflation-looms-000113901.html)

> US stocks rose on Friday after the Supreme Court ruled that President Trump's most sweeping "Liberation Day" tariffs are unlawful, saying he lacked the authority to impose them using emergency powers.
> The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose almost 0.7%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained roughly 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led gains, up nearly 0.9%. All three major averages posted weekly gains.
> Stocks reversed course on the heels of the decision as investors kept an eye out for US-Iran tensions and private credit jitters.
> The Supreme Court ruled on Friday morning that Trump overstepped his powers in invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose tariffs on several trading partners in April.
> In response, President Trump said in a press conference that his administration will be placing a "10% global tariff" to replace the duties struck down by the high court.

> Wall Street learned earlier Friday that US GDP grew more slowly than expected in the fourth quarter, coming in at 1.4%, far behind forecasts. Meanwhile, the "core" personal expenditures index — Fed rate-setters' preferred gauge of inflation — rose more than expected in December, on a monthly and annual basis.
> The watch is on for signs of stress in the private credit sector, after Blue Owl's (OBDC, OWL) halt to withdrawals. Fears are the move is a "canary in the coal mine" financial crisis-style moment amid concerns about the sector's holdings of software stocks threatened by AI.
> Stocks rose on Friday after the Supreme Court ruled that President Trump's emergency tariff policy was unlawful.
> The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose almost 0.7% to close out the week with gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained roughly 0.4% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped nearly 0.9%.
> President Trump on Friday afternoon announced a 10% global tariff in response to the levies that the high court struck down earlier that day.
> Investors will turn their focus to Nvidia (NVDA) earnings next Wednesday. The chip heavyweight is seen as the bellwether of the AI industry.
> Investors will turn their focus to Nvidia (NVDA) earnings next week. The AI chip heavyweight is seen as the bellwether of the AI industry.
> Nvidia shares are up nearly 2% year to date as investors have broadly rotated out of tech into more cyclical and defensive sectors.
> The company will report earnings next Wednesday after the market closes. Investors will be paying close attention to CEO Jensen Huang's commentary on data center growth, demand for its Blackwell and Rubin chips, and any discussion of China export controls.
> Cybersecurity software stocks fell on Friday after Anthropic announced a new security capability for its Claude AI model, resurfacing concerns of sector-wide disruption.
> CrowdStrike (CRWD) dropped 5%, while Zscaler (ZS) also fell about 3%. Meanwhile, Cloudflare (NET) shares decreased 6%.
> Anthropic said the new feature, available in a limited research preview, “scans codebases for security vulnerabilities and suggests targeted software patches for human review, allowing teams to find and fix security issues that traditional methods often miss.”
> Wall Street has been pushing back against the sell-off, which started in software and expanded into cybersecurity, wealth management, and even logistics in recent weeks. Investors fear AI will impact margins as customers turn to AI solutions and the barrier to entry for startups decreases.
> President Trump said in a press briefing on Friday that his administration will be placing a "10% global tariff ... over and above the normal tariffs already being charged" now that the Supreme Court has struck down his wide-sweeping tariff regime.
> In a 6-3 vote on Friday, the Supreme Court ruled that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not give the president the authority to levy tariffs, dealing a blow to the Trump administration's signature economic policy.
> The high court's ruling, Trump said at the briefing, was "deeply disappointing."
> In those tariffs' place, which the president claimed authority under IEEPA to implement, a global tariff authorized under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 will now be put in place, and the administration will be starting several trade investigations under Section 301.
> The White House, Trump said, is ready to replace his tariff regime, struck down by the Supreme Court, with "methods, statutes, practices, and authorities" recognized by the court system and Congress that "are even stronger than IEEPA tariffs."
> The alternative measures the administration will now put in place to replace the tariffs will "actually increase" the amount of money coming into the country, based on the court's decision, Trump said at the briefing.
> The president also mentioned that "all national security tariffs" under Section 232 and Section 301 "remain fully in place and in full force and effect."
> The Supreme Court's ruling on Friday leaves tariffs implemented under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 — which cite national-security concerns — unchanged, keeping in place a range of import duties on products ranging from copper and semiconductors to automobiles and wood products such as cabinetry.
> Section 232 tariffs include 50% levies on imports of semi-finished copper products, 25% levies on certain imported semiconductors — including Nvidia's (NVDA) H200 chips — and automobile tariffs, including 25% levies on trucks and 10% levies on buses.
> Furniture and cookware stocks are getting a boost following the highly anticipated Supreme Court ruling against President Trump's authority to issue tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).
> Bob's Discount Furniture (BOBS), which listed on the NYSE Feb. 5, was up as much as 5%. Wayfair (W), Arhaus (ARHS), and Williams-Sonoma Inc. (WSM) also made gains.
> In an interview with Yahoo Finance two weeks ago, Bob's Discount Furniture president and CEO Bill Barton called 2025 "a challenging year with tariffs."
> He added, "We don't sell any third-party brands; everything we sell is made for us. We have deep long-standing relationships with our manufacturing partners ... through those relationships, we were able to renegotiate costs, to get costs down to offset a lot of the tariffs."
> Like many retailers, Barton said the team moved countries and factories to reduce costs and, as a last resort, the company raised prices for consumers.
> The National Retail Federation said in a statement that this provides "much-needed certainty" for businesses and manufacturers alike.
> "Clear and consistent trade policy is essential for economic growth, creating jobs and opportunities for American families. We urge the lower court to ensure a seamless process to refund the tariffs to US importers. The refunds will serve as an economic boost and allow companies to reinvest in their operations, their employees and their customers," the release said.
> As our Ben Werschkul reported, though, there is still some lingering uncertainty around the future of Trump's tariff policy, as well as the possibility of refunds for these companies.
> The US Supreme Court's ruling on Friday that struck down President Trump's widespread tariff regime is bullish for the tech industry, Wedbush Securities managing director Dan Ives said in a client note after the ruling was announced.
> In a 6-3 vote released Friday morning, the US Supreme Court ruled that a 1977 national security law does not give the president authority to levy tariffs. Citing the more than $100 billion in potential tariff revenue refunds, the reversal could lead to a stronger financial outlook for the tech sector.
> "We believe this would act as a net positive for tech with financial relief for many companies while creating greater supply chain visibility, especially coming from the Asia supply chain," Ives wrote on Friday.
> Of note, the Supreme Court's Friday ruling, which struck down the president's authority to levy tariffs under the IEEPA law, did not affect tariffs imposed on national security grounds under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. Those tariffs include 50% levies on imports of semi-finished copper products, 25% levies on certain imported semiconductors — including Nvidia's (NVDA) H200 chips.
> "This will be a very noisy situation, but for the tech space and AI trade, it's a net positive out of the gates in our view," Ives wrote.
> The Dow Jones Transportation Average (^DJT) jumped to a five-day high on the SCOTUS/tariffs news, topping out around 1.7% before giving back many of those gains.
> At the highs, the index had retraced last week’s AI scare trade drop of roughly 4%.
> Participation is broad across rails and carriers: Union Pacific (UNP), CSX (CSX), Norfolk Southern (NSC); FedEx (FDX), UPS (UPS); Delta (DAL), United (UAL), American (AAL); plus logistics names like Old Dominion (ODFL), Expeditors (EXPD), XPO (XPO), and C.H. Robinson (CHRW).
> Southwest (LUV) and Alaska Air (ALK) are notable laggards.
> As long as the Dow Transports can stick near the top of today’s range, the post-ruling relief bid looks sticky. A full fade back below the morning pop would put last week’s drawdown back in play.
> CoreWeave (CRWV) stock fell as much as 9% early Friday after a report from Business Insider suggested lenders are worried about the company's creditworthiness.
> Blue Owl (OWL) has spent most of the time in the headlines this week over its decision to halt redemptions from a private credit fund (the company will instead return capital to shareholders on its own terms). Overall, the firm has continued to serve as the poster child of any worried about private credit in the market.
> But the CoreWeave story — along with Oracle (ORCL) — will also remain a key canary on any fears investors have about the durability or reliability of the AI data center build-out .
> With most of the focus on tariffs on Friday, a drop worth noting with Nvidia (NVDA) earnings up next week.
> Apparel names are catching a bid this morning after the Supreme Court struck down President Trump’s IEEPA tariffs — a broadly bullish initial read-through for import-heavy retailers.
> Nike (NKE) popped immediately on the headline — up about 4.4% at the highs — but has given back most of the gains. Under Armour (UAA), Levi Strauss (LEVI), Deckers Outdoor (DECK), and Kontoor Brands (KTB) saw similar knee-jerk lifts and retreats, to varying degrees.
> Even European brands like Adidas (ADS.DE, ADDYY) got pulled in.
> Speaking of European brands, a scan of the high-end luxury sector also reveals broad strength — Tapestry (TPR), LVMH (MC.PA, LVMUY), Hermès (RMS.PA, HESAY), Richemont (CFR.SW, CFRUY), Burberry (BRBY.L, BURBY).
> The closing print today will be critical to judge if this is a lasting tailwind trade.
> The Supreme Court's tariff ruling on Friday, which overturned President Trump's vast tariff regime instituted under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), does not affect other "Section 232" tariffs implemented through his second term on products ranging from metals and lumber to cars.
> In a 6-3 vote released Friday morning, the US Supreme Court ruled that IEEPA does not give the president authority to levy tariffs, dealing a major blow to what has become the signature tool of the Trump administration's foreign policy dealmaking.
> The ruling, however, leaves tariffs implemented under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 — which cite national-security concerns — unchanged, keeping in place a ream of import duties on products ranging from copper and semiconductors to automobiles and wood products such as cabinetry.
> Section 232 tariffs include 50% levies on imports of semi-finished copper products, 25% levies on certain imported semiconductors — including Nvidia's (NVDA) H200 chips — and automobile tariffs, including 25% levies on trucks and 10% levies on buses.
> The administration has also proposed 100% tariffs on specific pharmaceutical products, which, if implemented, would be done so under Section 232.
> The metals market saw only a slight reaction in the minutes after the ruling. Futures on copper (HG=F) rose by roughly 1.1%, while aluminum (ALI=F) ticked up by 0.6%. Elsewhere in the industrial sector, lumber (LBR=F) futures fell by roughly 0.4% on Friday as traders priced in cheaper import prices.
> Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) is the green-shoots standout in megacap stocks Friday morning, up over 2.5%.
> It's on pace for its best day in nearly three months, after a negative stretch where it was down six of the last seven sessions.
> The tape is catching the eyes of swing traders, given GOOGL opened above its five-day moving average after spending the prior 11 days trapped underneath it. Many punters — like Brian Shannon of AlphaTrends — will wait until a stock has climbed over its five-day moving average before buying (alongside other criteria, which vary from trader to trader).
> There's not a clean company headline driving the pop, though the news of the Supreme Court striking down President Trump's tariffs is providing broad strength to US stocks.
> Meanwhile, on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid this morning, Winthrop Capital chief investment officer Adam Coons was talking up the search giant, saying, "[Alphabet] is backed by real earnings … real revenue growth … really strong margins.”
> For many traders, as long as GOOGL holds above the five-day, the bounce is intact.
> Refunds on President Trump's widespread tariff scheme could cost the US as much as $175 billion, according to new estimates from Penn-Wharton Budget Model economists.
> Reuters first reported the new estimate.
> On Friday morning, the Supreme Court on Friday ruled in a 6-3 vote that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not give the president the authority to levy tariffs, dealing a blow to the Trump administration's signature economic policy and setting up a bevy of questions over what a reversal of the foreign policy will look like.
> Now that the president's tariff scheme has been struck down, importers are likely to begin scrambling to claim refunds from US Customs and Border Protection on import duties paid throughout the year.
> The White House has previously said that if the Supreme Court were to strike down Trump's IEEPA tariffs, the administration would replicate them through other policies that could mirror their effects.
> However, the replacement measures the White House will have at its disposal could be more limited in scope and slower to enact, according to Bloomberg.
> The Supreme Court on Friday ruled in a 6-3 decision that President Trump does not have the authority to levy a broad swath of tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).
> But the initial reaction from some on Wall Street is that this legal defeat is unlikely to mark the end of the administration's push to use tariffs to achieve its economic goals, primarily that of lowering our trade deficit and onshoring US manufacturing.
> "I don't think we have heard the last from Trump and tariffs," wrote Neil Dutta, head of economics at Renaissance Macro. There is a vast legal architecture that Trump can draw from to prosecute this... The issue is if he does not dial the tariff threat back on, he basically looks like a lame duck. The issue is more political than economic, at least right now. If Trump turns the trade knob back on, we get more uncertainty. If he decides to give in, then he is basically cooked politically."
> In a separate note, Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS, wrote, "The headline shock for markets, even if largely expected since the November 2025 Supreme Court arguments, is likely to fade in the trading days to follow."
> "It is important to realize that the import tariffs are only bringing in about $250 billion a year more than they did in the Biden administration," Rupkey added. "A $250 billion loss of revenue is not make or break for getting the country’s $7 trillion in Federal government spending under control, nor is it in any way fixing the fiscal year 2025 $1.7 trillion Federal budget deficit."
> The Supreme Court on Friday ruled in a 6-3 vote that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not give the president the authority to levy tariffs, dealing a blow to the Trump dministration's signature economic policy.
> Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, Neil Gorsuch, Amy Coney Barrett, and Ketanji Brown Jackson voted in the majority.
> Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Brett Kavanaugh formed the dissent.
> Throughout his second term, Trump has leaned on the IEEPA to grant him broad authority to set tariff policy as he saw fit, beginning with the April 2025 "Liberation Day" announcement of tariffs on a slew of allies and other countries. That announcement sent the markets careening downward before a recovery later in the year.
> It remains to be seen exactly how the Supreme Court's decision will impact the tariffs the president has already imposed. The market's initial reaction to Friday's ruling was muted.
> The US dollar (DX-Y.NYB) is at its highest level in nearly a month following a rally over the past two weeks, a typically bearish signal for stocks. Even so, readings on the US economy's direction give investors a broad range of opportunities in US equities, UBS strategists wrote in a client note Friday morning.
> Given the split in perspectives over where to take rates in the Fed's January meeting — the minutes were released on Wednesday — the Fed is likely to maintain its position and hold rates steady, said the UBS strategists, led by global wealth management CIO Mark Haefele.
> "While the minutes did not suggest officials were contemplating the possibility of rate increases, they made clear policymakers were in no rush to cut rates as 'the vast majority of participants judged that downside risks to employment had moderated in recent months while the risk of more persistent inflation remained,'" the UBS strategists wrote.
> Yet, despite the short-term hold on the horizon, the US central bank likely has "further to go its easing cycle, and this remains a key pillar in our positive outlook on US equities overall," the strategists wrote.
> "With the easing cycle still intact, and the US economy showing resilience amid an improvement in manufacturing activity and industrial output, we expect healthy and broadening profit growth across sectors," the strategists wrote, noting "attractive opportunities" in financials, health care, utilities, consumer discretionary, and industrials.
> The US stock market fell into the red on Friday as investors digested economic data that showed the US economy's growth slowed down in the fourth quarter, while so-called "core" PCE, the Fed's favored inflation gauge, heated up in December. The market is also watching tensions in the Middle East, nerves in the private credit market, and a potential tariff decision from the US Supreme Court.
> The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell by 0.2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slid into the red by 0.4% after a the end of a three-day winning streak on Thursday. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) turned down by 0.5% before paring losses to a slide of 0.2%.
> Prices rose by 0.4% in December over the previous month, according to Personal Consumption Expenditures index data, while the so-called "core" PCE, which excludes the more volatile food and energy categories, also rose 0.4% on the month, a step up from the previous month's 0.2% growth.
> New data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis on Friday showed the economy grew at an annualized rate of 1.4% in the final three months of 2025. Economists had expected GDP to grow at an annualized rate of 2.9% in the fourth quarter.
> I still think the strong earnings report out of Walmart (WMT) yesterday is a better proxy on the economy right now than a government GDP report.
> I got no indication (nor saw any in the earnings report) in my chat below with Walmart CFO John David Rainey the business has slowed at all:
> Prices rose by 0.4% in December over the previous month, marking an increase from the previous month, according to Personal Consumption Expenditures index data released Friday by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.
> The growth exceeded economists' expectations of 0.3%, according to Bloomberg's consensus estimates.
> So-called "core" PCE, which excludes the more volatile food and energy categories, also rose 0.4% on the month, a step up from the previous month's 0.2% growth. Economists had predicted that the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure would rise by 0.3%.
> On an annual basis, the headline and core PCE price indexes rose 2.9% and 3.0%, respectively, in December from the previous year, also slightly above economist estimates for the two gauges.
> Meanwhile, personal income remained consistent, rising 0.3% in December on a monthly basis, in line with the previous month's growth and matching economist expectations.
> Personal spending increased 0.4% from last month, coming in above expectations of 0.3% but falling below the previous month's growth of 0.5%.
> The US economy grew at a slower pace than expected in the fourth quarter of 2025.
> New data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis on Friday showed the economy grew at an annualized rate of 1.4% in the final three months of 2025. Economists had expected GDP to grow at an annualized rate of 2.9% in the fourth quarter.
> In a post on Truth Social ahead of the report, President Trump said the government shutdown that lasted 43 days back in the fall cost the US economy "at least two points in GDP." The president also again called for lower interest rates.
> In its release, the BEA said, "Compared to the third quarter, the deceleration in real GDP in the fourth quarter reflected downturns in government spending and exports and a deceleration in consumer spending that were partly offset by an acceleration in investment."
> Underlying spending trends, however, remained solid, with real final sales to private domestic purchasers — the sum of consumer spending and gross private fixed investment — increasing 2.4 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with an increase of 2.9 percent in the third quarter.
> Friday's report had been set for release on Jan. 29, but data collection was delayed by the shutdown that covered all of October and parts of November.
> Chemours Co. (CC) stock slumped 9% before the bell on Friday after reporting a loss of $47 million in its fourth quarter earnings.

## 📌 Topic: US-Iran Tensions (Oil Price Shock/Potential War)
*(Found 4 articles)*

### 1. [United States, Iran tensions cause jump in oil prices. What we know](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2026/02/20/us-iran-tensions-jump-oil-prices-what-to-know/88768110007/)
**Source**: USA TODAY | **Date**: 2026-02-20T08:14:00+00:00

> Tensions between the United States and Iran have caused an increase in oil prices across the country and in New Jersey, according to experts.
> Over the past few weeks, oil prices increased to highs not seen since last July because of the ongoing conflict, said Mark Schieldrop, senior spokesperson at AAA Northeast.
> In Bergen and Passaic counties, the average price for gasoline is $2.90, an increase from a month ago, when it was $2.76, according to AAA data.
> West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, a crude oil, has been set at $65.19 a barrel. This is an increase from about $55 late last year, said Daniela Hathorn, a senior market analyst for Capital.com.
> A main concern for the international conflict’s impact on oil prices is Iran’s ability to block cargo in and out of the Strait of Hormuz, where about 20% of the world’s oil and gas goes through, said Schieldrop and Hathorn.
> “Even with bountiful oil supplies here in the United States and an expectation for a global oil oversupply over the next few years, an escalating conflict would cause major disruption to product flows around the world and lead to higher prices,” said Schieldrop.
> Prices are already expected to increase over the spring months because of seasonal changes that occur every year, experts said.
> Demand for gasoline increases every year when the weather gets warmer. As demand rises, so will prices. The summer blend of gasoline also costs more to produce than winter blend, which contributes to the seasonal rising costs, said Schieldrop.
> Nationally, gasoline prices are the lowest they’ve been for this time of year since 2021, according to AAA. Hathorn believes because of these low prices, tension with Iran would cause gas prices to balloon at a higher rate.
> “Because oil prices are starting from a relatively low base, the market may be underpricing the scale of a potential upside spike if conflict materializes,” said Hathorn.
> Other analysts such as Patrick De Haan, who has been an expert in studying gasoline markets for two decades, is less concerned about the Iranian conflict. He acknowledges that the spike in prices are a result of the geopolitical events but believes future increases will be more because of standard seasonal reasons.
> De Haan does not expect the Iranian and United States tension will cause record-breaking changes like in 2022 when the Russia and Ukraine war, among other reasons, caused a steep increase in gasoline prices. He said this situation is different as Russia was a much larger oil supplier with less sanctions than Iran.
> “Don’t expect a record-setting year like in 2022 even if there is a major conflict with Iran,” said De Haan.
> Over the past few months, President Donald Trump has been threatening to use military force against Iran over the Middle Eastern nation’s nuclear program and recent violent crackdown against protesters.
> Trump said on social media on Jan. 28 that Iran would have to deal with an "armada" of warships if the country does not make a deal on nuclear weapons. The president has increased military presence at the Strait of Hormuz and the Persian Gulf.
> Threats have also been made against Iran if the country does not halt the killing of anti-government protesters. More than 6,800 deaths have been recorded since unrest began in December, according to The Human Rights Activists News Agency. Trump said Iran’s supreme leader told him the country has stopped killing protesters.
> Iran's leaders, like Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, have responded with self-defense threats if attacked. "We are not the initiators and do not want to attack any country, but the Iranian nation will strike a strong blow against anyone who attacks and harasses them," he said in Iranian state-run media.
> The United States government, along with the Israeli government, bombed Iranian nuclear targets in June 2025.
> Trump pulled out of an international nuclear accord with Iran during his first presidential term in 2018.

### 2. [Crypto Prices Today: Bitcoin Holds Firm at $67,000, XRP Down 0.55% as CLARITY Act Faces Senate Uncertainty](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/price-analysis/crypto-prices-today-bitcoin-holds-firm-at-67000-xrp-down-055-as-clarity-act-faces-senate-uncertainty)
**Source**: Analytics Insight | **Date**: 2026-02-20T07:37:00+00:00

> Bitcoin price today is up  0.76% at $67,243 as buyers absorb ETF selling pressure.
> Ethereum fell below the $2,100 support zone after repeated tests weakened demand. Thus, increasing the probability of a deeper pullback toward $1,500–$1,700.
> Stablecoin regulation talks, Trump-linked crypto scrutiny, and rising Japan rate hike expectations are creating policy-driven uncertainty.
> Crypto prices today showed bulls and bears going head-to-head. Bulls took a slight edge as Bitcoin trades in the green zone today after days of struggling in the red. The cryptocurrency continues to hold strong in the $66,000-$68,000 range. Top altcoins seem to have a mind of their own today, unfollowing BTC’s lead and mostly trading on a downward momentum. These included Ethereum, XRP, BNB, Dogecoin, and Bitcoin Cash. The others (Solana and Tron), however, showed some resilience. The global market cap climbed 0.12% to $2.31 trillion at press time. Investors are grappling with legislative developments in the US and Japan. Crypto news today regarding Trump moves and the CLARITY Act will be closely watched. The escalating war tensions betweeen US and Iran are also adding volatility in the market.Here is everything you need to know about crypto prices today based on CoinMarketCap data.
> Crypto prices today are mixed, with most major tokens showing modest gains or slight dips over the past 24 hours.
> Bitcoin (BTC) price today surges 0.76% over the last 24 hours to $67,243.57. The coin has a market cap of $1.34 trillion and over $31.7 billion in 24-hour trading volume. At the same time, US Bitcoin ETF holders are sitting on an average 20% unrealized loss, with an average cost basis near $84,000. ETFs have also turned net sellers in 2026, adding further downward pressure.CoinSwitch Markets Desk noted, “BTC is trading within the $65,700-$67,300 range. A brief dip toward $65,800 was quickly bought, reinforcing $66,000 as near-term support, while $67,000-$67,300 continues to cap upside. In the absence of a clear catalyst, price action remains in short-term consolidation.” The analysts further added, “BTC is on track for a fifth consecutive monthly decline, a pattern last seen in 2018-19, when six straight red months preceded a sharp multi-month rally of over 300%. With a similar pattern, momentum could begin shifting in early Q2 2026. Liquidity positioning suggests a move above $68,000 may trigger a short squeeze, while a break below $66,000 may trigger heavy long liquidations.”
> Ethereum (ETH) price today slips 1.49% to $1,940.60. Its market cap is at around $234 billion, with daily volume near $17.8 billion. ETH has now broken below the critical $2,100-$2,300 support level, raising questions about how low it could go. That support zone has now flipped into resistance, meaning sellers are actively defending that level.
> If bearish pressure continues to build, the next key area to watch is between $1,500 and $1,700. Some analysts are pointing to a fractal pattern, a repetition of a price structure that formed before Ethereum's big rally in late 2025. This pattern may result in a breakout if the setup plays out the same way.Nischal Shetty, Founder WazirX stated, “Ethereum trading near $1,950, reflects cautious sentiment amid tight macro conditions. Central bank patience, sticky inflation, and a strong dollar continue to constrain global liquidity, limiting upside across risk assets. This is evident in muted altcoin momentum and relatively contained Bitcoin volatility, a setup that often precedes larger directional moves. Within sectors, privacy-focused tokens such as ZEC and XVG outperformed over the last 24 hours, indicating renewed interest in transaction privacy amid broader uncertainty.”
> Here is a table showing the crypto prices of the world’s top ten cryptocurrencies by market cap at press time:
> Here are the top headlines impacting crypto prices today.
> The White House hosted its third closed-door meeting on February 19. It was held between crypto firms, including Coinbase, Ripple, and major banking groups, along with the Crypto Council for Innovation. Although no consensus was reached on the stablecoin yields issue, the participants described the tone as ‘constructive,’ as reported by The Block.  Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse told Fox Business he gives the bill a 90% chance of passing by the end of April. He added that ‘the White House is pushing hard.’ Prediction market, Polymarket, currently prices the odds at around 72% as of February 19 morning.
> Why does this matter for crypto prices? A clear stablecoin law would be a major catalyst for institutional confidence and adoption. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, speaking at a World Liberty Financial event at Mar-a-Lago, said Wall Street is ready to participate in crypto but only with a clear and rule-based regulatory framework. Without that clarity, major banks stay on the sidelines. According to a 99bitcoins report, his comments reinforce the idea that passing comprehensive US crypto legislation would unlock huge institutional capital flows into the market.
> A group of roughly 40 House Democrats sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on February 19 asking for an investigation into World Liberty Financial. The probe requested is over potential conflicts of interest and national security concerns. The letter cited Trump family's reported $500 million deal linked to an Emirati royal family, according to a Baha Breaking News report.
> Custodia Bank CEO Caitlin Long also pointed to controversy around President Trump's family crypto ventures, including World Liberty Financial, while talking about the US crypto bill. She said at ETH Denver this week that it is a ‘coin flip’ whether it passes. A major obstacle to getting the seven Democratic Senate votes needed to clear the 60-vote cloture threshold is the Trump family’s involvement in crypto. Senator Elizabeth Warren has been among the most vocal critics.
> Japan's national debt is now around 250% of GDP, the highest among developed nations. In the short term, this increases pressure on the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to raise interest rates. Markets currently price about an 80% chance of a BOJ hike by April. When the BOJ raises rates, the Japanese yen strengthens, and leveraged positions funded in cheap yen, the so-called ‘carry trade’, unwind quickly. Crypto markets, because they trade 24/7 with high leverage, tend to absorb the shock first. BTC dropped roughly 23% after the March 2024 hike, 26% after July 2024, and 31% after January 2025.
> In the longer term, however, Japan's debt trajectory strengthens Bitcoin's narrative as a hedge against currency debasement. Tokyo-listed Metaplanet is betting on this, holding over 35,000 BTC and targeting 100,000 BTC by the end of 2026.Nischal Shetty, Founder of WazirX echoed this optimistic sentiment, “Geopolitical tensions pushing oil higher are adding cross-market volatility, reinforcing Bitcoin’s neutrality, borderlessness, and censorship resistance. Meanwhile, AI-driven productivity and elevated global debt pose longer-term policy challenges that could pressure fiat stability, strengthening Bitcoin’s scarcity narrative. Although markets may remain range-bound in the near term, structural macro dynamics continue to support the long-term case for crypto as an alternative monetary asset class.”
> The bear market is claiming more casualties. This week, on-chain analytics platform Parsec announced it has shut down after five years. It has joined a long list of crypto businesses that have wound down since October's crash, including DappRadar, Bit.com, ZeroLend, Archblock, and others. The wave of shutdowns reflects just how far sentiment has fallen since the highs of late 2025.
> Bitcoin News Today: BTC Trades Near $66K as Spot ETFs Shed $133M Amid Deepening Risk Aversion
> Crypto prices today reflect a market deep in fear. US Legislative progress and Japan's long-term fiscal trajectory could serve as tailwinds. Avinash Shekhar, Co-founder and CEO, Pi42, “ While short-term traders have trimmed exposure, the absence of an aggressive breakdown suggests underlying demand remains intact. On-chain activity indicates that investors are gradually accumulating into weakness, absorbing supply as volatility compresses. This resilience near support levels reflects improving market depth compared to prior corrective phases.” The Co-founder and CEO, Pi42, further elaborated, “If Bitcoin continues to defend the $67,000–$70,000 range, it strengthens the case for a base-building phase and could allow prices to trend toward the $75,000 range. A sustained move higher could draw sidelined capital back into the market, particularly if macro uncertainty eases, potentially paving the way for a renewed push toward higher resistance zones.”Investors should keep an eye on near-term BOJ rate risk and regulatory uncertainty over the next 60 days.Also Read: XRP News Today: Deutsche Bank Expands Blockchain Push With Ripple-Linked Infrastructure
> 1. What is happening in the crypto market today?
> The crypto market is moving in a tight range today. Bitcoin is holding near $67,243 after gaining 0.76% in the last 24 hours. Ethereum has dropped 1.49% and broken below a key support level at $2,100. XRP and most altcoins are slightly down. Investors are cautious due to delays in the US crypto bill, ETF outflows, and fears of a possible rate hike in Japan.
> 2. What is the latest crypto news today?
> The biggest crypto news today is about US regulation and global rate risks. The White House held another closed-door meeting to discuss stablecoin rules. The CLARITY Act is still facing uncertainty in the Senate. At the same time, US Democrats are seeking a probe into a Trump-linked crypto venture. Japan’s possible rate hike is also adding pressure to global risk markets.
> 3. What is Bitcoin price today?
> Bitcoin price today is $67,243.57, up 0.76% in the last 24 hours. It remains stuck between the $66,000 and $68,000 range. Analysts say $66,000 is acting as short-term support, while $67,300-$68,000 is capping upside. Even though ETFs are seeing outflows, buyers are defending lower levels. However, Bitcoin is still about 47% below its October 2025 peak.
> 4. Has the US crypto bill passed?
> No, the US crypto bill has not been passed yet. The CLARITY Act is still under debate in the Senate. Industry leaders believe it has a strong chance of passing, but political disagreements are slowing progress. Concerns about Trump-linked crypto ventures have also added friction. Until lawmakers finalize clear rules, regulatory uncertainty will likely continue affecting market sentiment.
> 5. Will the Bank of Japan increase interest rates?
> Markets are pricing in around an 80% chance of a Bank of Japan rate hike by April. Japan’s debt levels are very high, which increases pressure on policymakers. If rates rise, the yen could strengthen, and leveraged trades may unwind quickly. In past hikes, Bitcoin fell sharply. This makes the upcoming BOJ decision an important short-term risk for crypto markets.

### 3. [American attack on Iran is a matter of when, not if](https://weeklyblitz.net/2026/02/21/american-attack-on-iran-is-a-matter-of-when-not-if/)
**Source**: Blitz | **Date**: 2026-02-20T21:45:00+00:00

> It’s pretty clear that yet another American attack on Iran is a matter of when, not if. It might occur over the weekend or perhaps after Ramadan, which ends in about a month from now. If the United States acts more tactfully, it might want to avoid attacking during Islam’s holiest month. However, if the pressure from the potential revelation of even more disturbing Epstein files continues, Washington DC might entirely drop all religious and geopolitical considerations and attack in the next few days. Either way, it’s virtually inevitable, as war, death and destruction flow in the veins of America’s pedophile-cannibalistic elites.
> In terms of practical possibilities, the upcoming war is defined by asymmetric advantages and disadvantages of both sides. The US holds an overwhelming superiority in more traditional military domains, while Iran has cultivated capabilities designed to impose disproportionate costs, exploit geography and leverage proxies to deter or prolong engagement. As of early 2026, nearly eight months after the so-called “12-Day War”, amid ongoing tensions, including US carrier deployments and the Iranian response with naval drills in the Strait of Hormuz, these asymmetries are even more pronounced.
> Obviously, the US enjoys decisive symmetrical advantages in most military technologies, power projection capabilities, combined arms operations, etc. Its edge stems from a massive military budget, a global network of vassals and satellite states, as well as an enormous intelligence apparatus. The US Navy’s carrier strike groups, including supercarriers such as the USS “Abraham Lincoln”, provide the tools for air superiority operations and precision strikes. The US Air Force operates airbases across the Middle East (particularly in Qatar, UAE and Saudi Arabia), enabling rapid, sustained bombing operations in the wider region.
> These capabilities are designed to degrade the command structures, missile bases and military infrastructure of countries targeted by the US. ABM (anti-ballistic missile) systems like THAAD, “Patriot” and “Aegis” are deployed to intercept ballistic missiles that might be used to strike American assets, although only for a short while before interceptor stockpiles are drained, as was the case during the aforementioned June 2025 clashes. These bases are also critical for US ISR (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance) capabilities, enabling excellent operational and strategic situational awareness.
> The Pentagon achieves this through a combination of satellites, drones, cyberwarfare assets and manned ISR aircraft, enabling real-time precision-strike capabilities. These technological advantages allow the US to conduct so-called “effects-based” operations, disrupting Iranian military cohesion without requiring a large-scale ground invasion, like the 2003 US aggression on Iraq. Even in a limited attack, the Pentagon could achieve certain key objectives, particularly through the so-called decapitation attacks, targeting key military and civilian leaders (officers, scientists, high-ranking officials, etc).
> However, all these advantages diminish quickly in a protracted or expanded conflict. The US military is optimized for short “shock & awe” engagements rather than enduring months or years of high-intensity conventional warfare. Even when faced with extremely low-tech opponents, Washington DC has a terrible track record against such groups, as evidenced by its humiliating defeat in Afghanistan, where the US military quite literally had to run for its life, leaving tens of billions worth of exorbitantly expensive equipment. Thus, the Pentagon must be able to overcome an opponent quickly and impose an immediate political solution or fall back.
> However, after decades of pointless US aggression in the Middle East, the political will for yet another war in the region is effectively non-existent. Not to mention that the number of Americans willing to participate in such a conflict has gone down dramatically, especially in comparison to just a decade ago (let alone 2001 or 2003, when people were galvanized by the highly controversial 9/11 attacks). There’s also the issue of financial and economic costs of such wars, particularly if they disrupt global energy markets. All this makes Americans not too keen to see yet another war.
> In stark contrast, Iran has numerous asymmetric advantages, particularly its ability to disrupt America’s operations all across the Middle East, as well as its potential for attrition warfare in a protracted conflict. Tehran has explicitly built a doctrine to make any aggressor pay an unbearable price without needing to win conventionally. Central to this is control over the Strait of Hormuz, through which 20-25% of global oil and LNG transits. The Iranian military specializes in exploiting all these asymmetric advantages, such as rapid-deployment tactics, fast-attack vessels, naval mines, swarms of very low-cost drones, etc.
> However, its most potent weapons are certainly those found in its massive missile arsenal. With regard to the Strait of Hormuz, Iranian anti-ship cruise and ballistic missiles, such as the “Khalij-e Fars” (dubbed “carrier killers” by many observers), can be particularly deadly. Namely, these assets can easily saturate US defenses in the confined waters of the Persian Gulf, dramatically raising risks for high-value assets like aircraft carriers. Even if these vessels ultimately survive, any sort of damage in a confrontation with Iran could leave them inoperable for months (if not years in case of more significant hits or even total destruction).
> Tehran’s ballistic missile arsenal, one of the largest in the world (and by far the largest in the Middle East), includes precision-guided short and medium-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs and MRBMs) capable of striking virtually all US bases in the Middle East. The June 2025 war demonstrated Iran’s willingness to launch hundreds of missiles and drones in barrages, overwhelming defenses both through sheer volume and the use of advanced weapons, including hypersonic missiles such as the “Fattah-1/2”, although Western sources still insist these are no more than highly advanced MRBMs.
> And yet, even if armed only with MaRV (maneuverable reentry vehicle) warheads, these weapons are still capable of penetrating all ABM systems deployed by the US, its allies, vassals and satellite states. More disturbingly for the Pentagon, it’s virtually impossible to eliminate the TEL (transporter, erector, launcher) vehicles carrying these missiles, particularly as the Iranian military uses numerous underground facilities, dramatically enhancing their survivability. This ensures a high level of conventional deterrence that makes the US think twice before deploying certain weapon systems, particularly in the vicinity of Iranian borders and waters.
> In addition, although it suffered several major strategic setbacks and has been severely weakened by decapitation strikes, the “Axis of Resistance” is still not to be ignored. Hezbollah, numerous Iraqi Shia militias, the so-called Houthis and other smaller groups also extend Iran’s already strong regional reach. This enables plausible-deniability strikes on the invading American forces, their supply lines and logistics in general. They can act in multiple theaters, including Iraq, Yemen and Lebanon. What’s more, both the Iranian cyberwarfare capabilities and more traditional intelligence operations are also not to be overlooked.
> Geographic and societal factors also heavily favor Iran in a defensive war. Harsh mountainous terrain, fortified sites and a large population determined to defend their country provide resilience against a direct land invasion or regime-change efforts. The Iranian leadership’s very survival is seen as a defeat for the US, eroding what little political support Washington DC can muster at home for such a war. This is perhaps the crux of Iran’s asymmetric advantages, as the people overwhelmingly support their government and system, despite decades of sanctions and pressure.
> In summary, while the US might possess an escalation advantage in the early stages of the upcoming conflict, where it might even inflict significant damage on military and economic targets, Iran’s capability to respond asymmetrically and maintain a more protracted war makes it very difficult (if not impossible) for the Pentagon to achieve the victory it wants. Not to mention that the US is not too happy with a scenario where global oil and LNG supplies are disrupted, leading to price hikes that might benefit Russia. And yet, while the aforementioned asymmetries favor mutual deterrence over direct warfare, the US still won’t let “a good war go to waste”.

### 4. [Trump could attack Iran in days — what's at stake for the oil market](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/20/trump-could-attack-iran-in-days-whats-at-stake-for-the-oil-market.html)
**Source**: CNBC | **Date**: 2026-02-20T09:47:00+00:00

> A full-blown war between the United States and Iran could, in a worst-case scenario, send oil prices soaring and cause an economic downturn.
> With a massive U.S. military buildup underway in the Middle East, President Donald Trump signaled Thursday that he will decide in the next 10 days whether to launch strikes against Iran.
> "This Iranian situation just scares the daylights out of this market consistently," John Kilduff, founder of Again Capital, told CNBC. "There will be some mischief made by Iran and that's what the market is pricing in."
> Trump has warned Iran that an attack would be "far worse" than the limited U.S. airstrikes that targeted its nuclear facilities last June, but has also left open the possibility that negotiations could still hammer out a deal governing Iran's nuclear program.
> Oil prices have risen more than 5% this week as traders price in the growing risk of military action. The market's biggest fear is that war would disrupt oil flows through the Strait of Hormuz.
> The strait is a vital choke point for the global oil trade. More than 14 million barrels per day of oil and condensates passed through the narrow waterway on average in 2025, according to data from consulting firm Kpler, which says that accounts for a third of total worldwide seaborne oil exports.
> About three-quarters of the oil that passes through the strait goes to China, India, Japan and South Korea, according to Kpler.
> Iran's Revolutionary Guard on Tuesday partially closed the strait for several hours to conduct military exercises. The Guard is prepared to shut down the strait if ordered by Iran's leaders, according to the semiofficial Tasnim news agency, citing Iranian Navy Rear Adm. Alireza Tangsiri.
> "Iran could disrupt Hormuz for a lot longer than many market participants think," said Bob McNally, founder of Rapidan Energy and former White House energy advisor to President George W. Bush.
> The U.S. could face a situation similar to the 52-day air campaign against Houthi militants in Yemen who disrupted the Red Sea with missile attacks — but worse, McNally said.
> "Iran has much better weaponry and much better coastline to operate from than the Houthis," the energy strategist said. It also boasts vast stockpiles of mines and short-range missiles that could make the strait unsafe for commercial traffic.
> "Lloyd's is not going to allow or insure tankers to go through Hormuz in that kind of environment," McNally said, referring to London insurers.
> Global energy markets cannot balance supply and demand without the oil that flows through the strait, McNally said. A prolonged closure would send oil prices above $100 per barrel, curbing demand and potentially precipitating an economic downturn, he said.
> Iran may calculate that it can precipitate Trump's worst fears by tanking the economy ahead of the U.S. midterm elections in November, McNally said.
> Rystad Energy sees oil prices rapidly rising by $10 to $15 per barrel in a scenario where there's a wider conflict between the U.S. and Iran, according to a research note published earlier this month.
> But Trump also has a wide range of options, including a blockade or other actions, that fall short of full-blown regional war, McNally said.
> Any U.S. military action is likely "to be surgical and designed to avoid Iran's oil production and export infrastructure," said Natasha Kaneva, head of global commodities strategy at JPMorgan, in a Thursday report. A post-strike rally in crude oil prices would "eventually fade as global fundamentals remain relatively soft," Kaneva said.
> Goldman Sachs similarly doesn't see a risk of a major, sustained supply disruption, at least in its base case, said Daan Struyven, head of oil research, in an interview with CNBC. But a conflict that leads to the loss of 1 million barrels per day of Iranian exports for a year would raise crude oil prices by $8 and force the market to reassess the risk of further escalation, he said.
> And the Trump administration also appears nonchalant about the risk of a disruption in the Middle East.
> "The world is very well supplied with oil right now," Energy Secretary Chris Wright told CNBC in a Feb. 6 interview, giving the president "more leverage in his geopolitical actions to not worry about a crazy spike in oil prices."

### 2. [Sticky Inflation Likely to Keep Fed on Hold Despite Weaker Economy](https://www.investopedia.com/sticky-inflation-likely-to-keep-fed-on-hold-despite-weaker-economy-11911001)
**Source**: Investopedia | **Date**: 2026-02-20T21:10:00+00:00

> Get personalized, AI-powered answers built on 27+ years of trusted expertise.
> An uptick in inflation in December validates the Federal Reserve’s pause in cutting interest rates, analysts say, even though economic growth data at year-end looked disappointing.
> Fed officials received two varying stories of the economy in Friday’s data releases. One pointed to weakening: Real GDP grew by 1.4% in the fourth quarter, dragged down by a weeks-long government shutdown. Growth was sharply below consensus estimates of 2.5%.
> The other pointed to hotter trends. The Fed’s preferred inflation gauge rose to 3% year-over-year in December, up from 2.8% in November. The reading suggests progress toward the central bank’s goal of 2% may be stalled.
> “The higher inflation reading justifies the Fed moving to the sidelines and holding the policy rate steady for a while longer,” wrote Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide.
> Not that the Fed may stay there forever. Bostjancic expects inflation to keep marching back down in the months ahead, since rental prices are softening and tariff-driven inflation is fading. That could open the door for two rate cuts by year-end, Bostjancic wrote.
> Sticky inflation could delay further rate cuts, affecting borrowing costs for consumers and businesses. At the same time, slowing growth raises questions about how long the Fed can stay on hold.
> The Fed lowered interest rates three times in 2025, bringing its benchmark rate down to 3.5% to 3.75%. But some officials at the Fed are wary of cutting rates again until inflation is back to target.
> “Looking ahead, I anticipate we’ll see progress on inflation this year,” Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan, one of the Fed’s more hawkish members, said this month. “But I am not yet fully confident inflation is heading all the way back to 2%.”
> The Fed tends to cut interest rates when the economy is softening—much as it did last year when job growth was stalling. But many analysts anticipate sunnier prospects for the economy in 2026.
> “The core of the economy is resilient,” wrote Michael Pearce, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. “With tariff pressures fading and tax cuts beginning to fuel an increase in capital spending, the economy will gather momentum in 2026.”
> Consumer spending rose at a solid pace that’s “not indicative of a slowing economy,” wrote Richard de Chazal, macro analyst at William Blair. Stronger business investment in equipment is also a sign of an “unfolding capex boom,” de Chazal wrote, as companies step up their capital expenditures.
> “From the Fed’s perspective, it will likely look through the noise from the shutdown, and see few signs of economic deterioration that would necessitate further rate cuts for the time being,” he wrote.
> Others are a bit less optimistic. When excluding the shutdown impact, the economy’s momentum was solid but is also “likely to wane” this year, wrote Samuel Tombs, chief U.S. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
> Technology expenses continue to boost business investment, he wrote, pointing to an “ongoing divergence between tech-related sectors and the rest.” Residential investment fell by 1.5%, he added, marking the sixth consecutive drop in the last seven quarters.
> The rise in consumer spending is also “over-reliant on consumers saving less,” he added, rather than large wage increases driving up expenditures.
> “Bumper tax refunds will lift consumption briefly this spring, but by mid-year it will be clear that spending has slowed amid still-weak employment growth and slower wage gains,” Tombs wrote.
> That should help prompt a resumption in the Fed’s rate cuts, he said, even as officials “will continue to wait for further signs" of inflation returning to 2% before easing policy again.

### 3. [Gold rises on U.S.-Iran tensions and lower European bond yields](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/20/gold-heads-for-weekly-loss-as-dollar-advances.html)
**Source**: CNBC | **Date**: 2026-02-20T10:34:00+00:00

> Gold prices rose more than 1% on Friday, supported by weaker‑than‑expected U.S. GDP data, while investors digested President Donald Trump's announcement of fresh global tariffs following the U.S. Supreme Court's tariffs ruling.
> Spot gold was up 1.5% at $5,071.48 an ounce by 02:08 p.m. (1908 GMT). U.S. gold futures for April delivery settled 1.7% higher at $5,080.90.
> "It's hard to see the president collecting his toys and going home; he will try to re-establish tariffs using other statutes which will promote volatility," said Tai Wong, an independent metals trader.
> Medium-term uncertainty won't deter gold bulls, Wong added.
> Trump said that he would impose a 10% global tariff for 150 days to replace some of his emergency duties that were struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court.
> The Supreme Court declared illegal his broad global tariffs imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, ruling that he had overstepped his authority under that law.
> Wall Street's main stock indexes jumped on Friday after the Supreme Court ruling.
> Data showed U.S. economic growth slowed sharply to a 1.4% annualized rate in Q4, well below economists' forecast of 3%, as the government shutdown and softer consumer spending hit activity.
> Separately, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditure index, rose 0.4% in December, above expectations for a 0.3% increase.
> "(The data) shows inflation is still present in the marketplace ... but with GDP coming in lower, it suggests the economy is not close to a turning point. There are still many unknowns and uncertainties around the U.S. economy, and that is supportive for gold," said RJO Futures senior market strategist Bob Haberkorn.
> Traders still expect two 25-basis-point rate cuts by the Fed this year, with the first expected in June.
> Gold, considered a safe-haven asset when there is geopolitical and economic uncertainty, also tends to do well when interest rates are low.
> Elsewhere, spot silver gained 5.8% to $82.92 an ounce. Spot platinum rose 4.5% to $2,163.53, while palladium added 4% to $1,751.70.

### 4. [Minneapolis Fed's Kashkari: 'We're pretty close to neutral' on rates](https://www.aol.com/articles/minneapolis-feds-kashkari-were-pretty-163901919.html)
**Source**: AOL | **Date**: 2026-02-19T23:39:00+00:00

> Minneapolis Fed president Neel Kashkari said Thursday he thinks the central bank is “pretty close” to neutral on the level of its benchmark policy rate, implying there may be little room left to cut rates.
> “We've cut interest rates a bunch in the last couple of years,” Kashkari said during a fireside chat at the Fargo Moorhead West Fargo Chamber of Commerce. “My guess is we're pretty close to neutral on where our monetary policy is, but ultimately, we need to see, where does inflation go? Does it come all the way back down to 2%? What happens to the unemployment rate? Does it keep going up, or does it level off, or does it come back down?”
> Read more: How jobs, inflation, and the Fed are all related
> Kashkari said that the yield on the 10-year government Treasury bond tells him that the neutral rate — a level designed to neither boost nor slow economic growth — is probably higher than it was before. He said the build-out of data centers is likely to boost investment and capital flows, boosting interest rates.
> “All else being equal, rates are going to be higher because that's how capital has to flow to that sector of the economy,” he said.
> When it comes to the job market, Kashkari called it “softer” than it was a year or two ago, but noted that looking out across the country, the job market seems “pretty good.”
> Kashkari is the latest official to strike a hawkish tone. Fed Governor Michael Barr said this week that he’d like to see evidence that goods prices are coming down before lowering rates and that he expects to hold rates for “some time.” Chicago Fed president Austan Goolsbee told Yahoo Finance on Friday that he would also like to see further progress on inflation falling to the Federal Reserve's 2% target before supporting another rate cut.
> Minutes from the Fed’s policy meeting released Wednesday revealed a divided Fed with an increasing bias toward bringing down inflation. Several Federal Reserve officials anticipate further interest rate cuts if inflation were to drop, but others saw holding rates for "some time," while a “number” saw no rate cuts until there's a clear indication that inflation is "firmly back on track."
> A reading of the Consumer Price Index for January, released Feb. 13, showed prices rose 2.4% over the prior year. On a "core" basis, which excludes food and energy, prices rose 2.5% over the prior year.
> This Friday, the Commerce Department will release the Fed's preferred inflation gauge — the Personal Consumption Expenditures index — which economists expect to have risen 2.9% in December on a core basis. That would compare with 2.8% in November.

### 5. [Treasury bills seen as primary driver of Bitcoin's price: Report](https://cointelegraph.com/news/treasury-bills-primary-driver-bitcoin-price)
**Source**: Cointelegraph | **Date**: 2026-02-20T06:30:00+00:00

> New Keyrock research finds not all newly created money impacts risk assets due to how fresh liquidity flows through the economy.
> Cointelegraph in your social feed
> Treasury bill issuance is the primary liquidity metric that impacts Bitcoin’s (BTC) price and not the Federal Reserve or any other central bank’s balance sheet, according to a new report from crypto investment firm and market maker Keyrock.
> Every 1% change in global liquidity levels impacts BTC’s price by 7.6% the following business quarter in which new money is created. However, not all liquidity impacts risk asset prices equally, Keyrock researcher Amir Hajian said.
> Treasury bill issuance has had about an 80% correlation with BTC prices since 2021, and this metric leads BTC prices by about eight months, according to the report. Hajian wrote:
> Historically, rising net Treasury bill issuance has exhibited a leading statistical relationship with Bitcoin returns,” the report continued.
> Despite this high correlation, institutions and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have dampened Bitcoin’s sensitivity to liquidity conditions by about 23%.
> The analysis contradicts the widespread theory that interest rate policy set by the Federal Reserve is the primary driver of liquidity impacting risk asset prices and forecasts that global liquidity will impact BTC prices in late 2026 and early 2027.
> Related: Bitcoin passes $69K on slower US CPI print, but Fed rate-cut odds stay low
> Global liquidity is at an “inflection” point, Keyrock’s report said, adding that a large swath of the $38 trillion US national debt is maturing over the next four years.
> This means the US Treasury will have to refinance the debt at higher interest rates, much of which was financed under near-zero interest rates.
> The US will likely ramp up Treasury bill issuance to roll over the debt, the Keyrock analyst said.
> “T-bill issuance is projected to reach and sustain $600 billion to $800 billion per year through 2028,” the Keyrock report said.

> Cyclical risk involves the fluctuations in business or economic cycles that impact investment returns, asset class values, and company profits.
> Understanding cyclical risks is essential for investors seeking to safeguard and grow their investments amid market volatility.
> Macro hedging and sector rotation are two strategies that investors can use to manage such risks.
> This article will break down types of cyclical risk and help you understand how these cycles occur and discover ways to mitigate these economic fluctuations effectively.
> Cyclical risks exist because the broad economy has been shown to move in cycles—periods of peak performance followed by a downturn, then a trough of low activity. Between the peak and trough of a business or economic cycle, investments may fall in value, reflecting lower profits and the uncertainty surrounding future returns.
> Cyclical risk does not typically have a tangible measure, but instead is reflected in the prices or valuations of assets that are deemed to have higher or lower cyclical risks than the market. Some companies are more volatile than others, struggling during an economic slowdown and excelling when a recovery is underway. To reflect the risks associated with their volatile share prices, these firms often trade on lower valuations.
> Defensive stock sectors, such as consumer staples focused on food, power, water, and gas, are less vulnerable to economic volatility because their products are deemed to be essential purchases even during a recession. In contrast, discretionary expenses tend to decline during a downturn, impacting, for example, consumer discretionary stocks that specialize in luxury items, leisure, and entertainment.
> A few prevalent investing strategies exist to provide risk mitigation and return opportunities during various market cycles. Macro hedging and sector rotation are two strategies that investors can use to manage and profit from cyclical risks. These fall under the umbrella of hedging strategies and are actively managed investment strategies that help investors navigate through market cycles, mitigating losses and capturing opportunities for gains.
> Individual businesses and sectors can also experience market cycles caused by idiosyncratic risks.
> The economic or business cycle is influenced by a number of factors, including company investment, consumer spending, and banks lending money at affordable rates. To get a better handle on cyclical risks, investors are advised to keep tabs on the following indicators, each of which can help us to identify where we are in the cycle.
> The incremental price increase of goods and services in an economy is highly cyclical and can pose its own risk to investors, while also causing cyclical risks in the economy. That is why commonly used inflation indexes, such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Wholesale Price Index (WPI), are closely monitored.
> To manage inflation risks, investors typically turn to inflation trades that provide protection and possible upside potential in times of rising prices. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) are a popular inflation trade that can protect investors. High-growth sectors of the economy are also leading areas of investment when inflation is rising.
> When inflation surges, central banks seek to encourage people to spend less by hiking interest rates. Eventually, this leads demand to taper off and company revenues and share prices to fall.
> Investors regularly focus on the yield curve to determine whether interest rates are likely to rise in the future. Signs that higher borrowing costs are forthcoming often lead cyclical stocks to fall out of favor and defensive, cash-rich firms to soar in popularity.
> Companies often become greedy when times are good. Capacity is ramped up and competition intensifies until supply outstrips demand and profits vanish.
> Investors can look at capital expenditure (CapEx)-to-depreciation ratios to identify signs of excessive investment. Capital spending efficiency across entire nations can also be tracked by checking out capacity utilization rates. Historically, a rate of 82% or higher hints that a recession could be forthcoming.
> Cyclical risk is the risk of business cycles or other economic cycles adversely affecting the returns of an investment, an asset class, or an individual company's profits.
> Inflation, interest rates, and capital expenditure (CapEx) are three types of cyclical risk.
> Monitoring inflation indexes like the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) helps to gauge cyclical risks.
> Investors should not only keep tabs on cyclical risks, but also employ strategies like macro hedging and sector rotation to manage them and profit from them.

> WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. economic growth slowed in the final three months of last year, dragged down by the six-week shutdown of the federal government and a pullback in consumer spending.
> The nation’s gross domestic product — the total output of goods and services — increased at a 1.4% annual rate in the fourth quarter, the Commerce Department reported Friday, down from 4.4% in the July-September quarter and 3.8% in the quarter before that.
> The figures point to what could be a more modest pace of growth in the coming quarters, as consumers have taken on more debt and saved less to maintain their spending, a process that may be difficult to sustain. Business investment, other than data centers and equipment dedicated to artificial intelligence, grew at only a moderate pace.
> Still, a measure of underlying growth that focuses on consumer and business spending was mostly healthy at 2.4%, economists said. The sharp slowdown in government outlays because of the shutdown shaved a full percentage point from growth.
> AP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports on a key inflation measure rising unexpectedly in December.
> Consumers and companies spent at a “reasonably solid” pace, said Martha Gimbel, executive director of the Budget Lab at Yale and former economist in the Biden White House. “This is not a disastrous report.”
> Also Friday, the Supreme Court struck down many of President Donald Trump’s tariffs, which have lifted inflation slightly and likely discouraged many companies from hiring by raising their costs. At a news conference, Trump quickly promised to reimpose the tariffs under different laws than the one the court invalidated.
> Consumer spending also rose 2.4% in the fourth quarter, a solid increase but notably below the third quarter’s healthy 3.5% gain. Federal government outlays plunged nearly 17% amid the shutdown. That decline should mostly reverse in the coming quarters, however.
> The outsize growth last summer and fall — when the economy expanded at about a 4% annual pace — partly reflected sharply lower imports. Companies ramped up imports in the first quarter of last year to get ahead of President Donald Trump’s tariffs. After boosting growth in the second and third quarters, trade had little impact at the end of last year.
> Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG, said the report reflected a “one-legged” economy boosted mostly by artificial intelligence, which is fueling business spending and has also lifted wealth for those households that own stocks and have benefited from rising share prices.
> Many households, however, have had to take on more debt to fuel their spending. The saving rate dropped to just 3.6% in the fourth quarter, the second-lowest figure since August 2008, when the economy was mired in the Great Recession.
> “The economy looks golden on paper, but beneath the surface is lead,” Swonk said.
> Early Friday, before the figures were released, Trump attacked congressional Democrats for shutting down the government last fall. He also reiterated his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for not cutting interest rates more quickly.
> “The Democrat Shutdown cost the U.S.A. at least two points in GDP,” Trump posted on his social media site. “That’s why they are doing it, in mini form, again. No Shutdowns! Also, LOWER INTEREST RATES. “Two Late” Powell is the WORST!!!”
> A separate report Friday showed that inflation, according to the Fed’s preferred measure, accelerated in December, as the cost of goods such as furniture, clothes, and groceries picked up. That makes it less likely the Fed will reduce its key interest rate in the coming months.
> Earlier this month, Trump predicted a blowout gain in GDP of more than 5% even if the government shutdown was factored into the figures. Trump has been trying to claim that the economy is at its strongest point in history, even though the new data shows that growth slowed, compared with 2024, following his return to the White House.
> The data arrives before Trump delivers the State of the Union address on Tuesday, where he is expected to say that the economy is booming.
> The report also underscores an odd aspect of the U.S. economy: It is growing steadily, but without creating many jobs. Growth was a solid 2.2% in 2025, yet a government report last week showed that employers added less than 200,000 jobs last year — the fewest since COVID struck in 2020.
> Economists point to several possible reasons for the gap: The Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration has sharply slowed population growth, reducing the number of people available to take jobs. It’s one reason that the unemployment rate rose only slightly — to 4.3% from 4% — last year, even with the nearly non-existent hiring.
> Some businesses may also be holding back on adding jobs out of uncertainty about whether artificial intelligence will enable them to produce more without finding new employees. And the cost of tariffs has reduced many companies’ profits, possibly leading them to cut back on hiring.
> The economy is also unusual right now because growth is solid, inflation has slowed a bit, and unemployment is low, but surveys show that Americans are generally gloomy about the economy. In January, a measure of consumer confidence fell to its lowest level since 2014, yet consumers have kept spending, propelling growth.
> Some of that spending may be disproportionately driven by upper-income consumers, in a phenomenon known as the “K-shaped” economy. Yet data from many large banks suggests lower-income consumers are still raising their spending, even if by not as much.
> Associated Press Writer Josh Boak contributed to this story.

> An esteemed American economist isn't feeling good about where things are headed.
> Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel laureate and Columbia economist, said he believes the US economy would continue to weaken when speaking to CNBC about his macro outlook on Thursday. That's largely due to a handful of issues he sees hanging over the US, he said, pointing to tariffs, a decline in jobs, and interest rates in particular.
> "Not great right now, and the prospects are that we're just going to get worse," Stiglitz said of his economic outlook.
> His downbeat sentiment regardi g the US economy doesn't square with recent growth figures. GDP grew at a robust 4.4% in the third quarter, and is expected to have expanded by 3% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, according to the latest estimates from the Atlanta Fed.
> But there are a few under-the-surface details that suggest the economy isn't on a good path, Stiglitz suggested. Here's what explains his pessimistic view about where the US is headed:
> President Donald Trump's tariffs are hanging in the balance at the Supreme Court, but should they stick around, the import taxes are expected by many economists to raise prices for consumers.
> Moreover, the inflationary impact of tariffs is regressive, meaning they're expected to impact lower-income consumers the most, Stiglitz said.
> An analysis from The Budget Lab at Yale University found that, over the short run, tariffs are expected to hit the bottom 10% of US households the hardest, reducing disposable income by an estimated 3.5 percentage points.
> "If you look at who is paying these tariffs, it is the lower-end people in terms of percentage of their incomes," Stiglitz said. "It's regressive and it's distortive."
> President Trump has said that tariffs would help jump-start a revival in America's manufacturing sector, but a recovery isn't yet visible in broad-strokes employment data, Stiglitz said.
> Manufacturing, one of the US's largest industries, is estimated to make up around 10% of GDP.
> Employment in the manufacturing sector has declined for more than two years straight, according to data from the Labor Department.
> "The decline in blue-collar jobs is even larger," Stiglitz said. "The point is there's a mismatch between what they say — they've done these policies, these are the results."
> Stiglitz also pointed to the push from the Trump administration to lower interest rates.
> In particular, he pointed to recent comments from Kevin Warsh, Trump's Fed Chair nominee, who said that AI could unlock a productivity boom in the US. In that scenario, the economy could grow without stoking inflation, meaning the US could have room to lower interest rates more than markets expect.
> Stiglitz said he was "most disturbed" by Warsh's comments.
> Among investors, the fear is that the central bank could lower rates prematurely, which could lead to hotter inflation down the line.
> Additionally, if the Fed were to be seen as caving to political pressure to cut rates, that could undermine the Fed's credibility, which could also unanchor inflation expectations.
> "I don't think there's any significant body of thought that thinks that AI productivity increases are going to percolate into the macro economy fast enough to justify any significant or with any impact on rate increases. And the fact that he said that, to me, was very worrisome," Stiglitz said.

### 4. [Fiscal and Monetary Policy: Key Differences and Economic Impact](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/050615/fiscal-vs-monetary-policy-pros-cons.asp)

> Fiscal and monetary policy are the two main tools governments use to manage the economy and balance growth, inflation, and unemployment. Monetary policy, run by central banks, adjusts interest rates and the money supply to either stimulate activity or cool excess demand.
> Fiscal policy works through government taxation and spending, increasing public outlays or cutting taxes to boost growth, or doing the opposite to slow an overheating economy. Each approach has strengths and drawbacks, and the discussion that follows examines how they compare.
> Monetary policy refers to the actions taken by a country's central bank to achieve its macroeconomic policy objectives. Some central banks are tasked with targeting a particular level of inflation. In the United States, the Federal Reserve Bank (the Fed) has been established with a mandate to achieve maximum employment and price stability.
> This is sometimes referred to as the Fed's "dual mandate." Most countries separate the monetary authority from any outside political influence that could undermine its mandate or cloud its objectivity. As a result, many central banks, including the Federal Reserve, are operated as independent agencies.
> When a country's economy is growing at such a fast pace that inflation increases to worrisome levels, the central bank will enact restrictive monetary policy to tighten the money supply, effectively reducing the amount of money in circulation and lowering the rate at which new money enters the system. Raising the prevailing risk-free interest rate will make money more expensive and increase borrowing costs, reducing the demand for cash and loans.
> The Fed can also increase the level of reserves commercial and retail banks must keep on hand, limiting their ability to generate new loans. Selling government bonds from its balance sheet to the public in the open market also reduces the money in circulation. Economists of the Monetarist school adhere to the virtues of monetary policy.
> When a nation's economy slides into a recession, these same policy tools can be operated in reverse, constituting a loose or expansionary monetary policy. In this case, interest rates are lowered, reserve limits loosened, and bonds are purchased in exchange for newly created money. If these traditional measures fall short, central banks can undertake unconventional monetary policies such as quantitative easing (QE).
> During and after the Great Recession, the Fed made use of quantitative easing as a means to spur the economy.
> Fiscal policy refers to the tax and spending policies of a nation's government. A tight, or restrictive fiscal policy includes raising taxes and cutting back on federal spending. A loose or expansionary fiscal policy is just the opposite and is used to encourage economic growth. Many fiscal policy tools are based on Keynesian economics and hope to boost aggregate demand.
> Fiscal policy is policy enacted by the legislative branch of government. It deals with tax policy and government spending. Monetary policy is enacted by a government's central bank. It deals with changes in the money supply of a nation by adjusting interest rates, reserve requirements, and open market operations. Both policies are used to ensure that the economy runs smoothly since the policies seek to avoid recessions and depressions as well as to prevent the economy from overheating.
> The main tools of monetary policy are changes in interest rates, changes in reserve requirements (how much reserves banks need to keep on hand), and open market operations, which is the buying and selling of U.S. Treasuries and other securities.
> Fiscal policy involves two main tools: taxes and government spending. To spur the economy and prevent a recession, a government will reduce taxes in order to increase consumer spending. The fewer taxes paid, the more disposable income citizens have, and that income can be used to spend on the economy. A government will also increase its own spending, such as on public infrastructure, to prevent a recession.
> Monetary and fiscal policy each play a role in supporting steady growth, low inflation, and healthy employment, and neither works as a one-size-fits-all solution.
> Monetary policy can be implemented quickly to influence borrowing and spending, while fiscal policy can target specific sectors through taxation and government outlays, though both have limitations, such as time lags or political constraints. When coordinated effectively, these tools can complement each other and help stabilize the economy, especially during periods of crisis and recovery.

> The U.S. economy slowed in the final months of last year,  but it continued to expand, thanks to robust consumer spending and business investment in artificial intelligence.
> A report from the Commerce Department on Friday shows the economy grew at an annual rate of 1.4% in October, November and December.  That compares to a 4.4% pace the previous quarter.
> For all of 2025, the nation's gross domestic product grew 2.2%, following 2.4% growth in 2024.  (Both measures compare the size of the economy at year's end to where it was 12 months earlier.)
> Consumer spending is the biggest driver of the U.S. economy, and that trend continued in the final months of last year.  Personal spending rose at an annual rate of 2.4% in the fourth quarter.
> "The consumer drives the economic train," says Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics.
> Spending was propped up in part by wealthy Americans who have been been cheered by the rising value of their homes and stock portfolios.
> "The well-to-do, they're doing great and they're out spending," Zandi says. "Folks in the bottom and middle of the income distribution, not so much."
> Businesses that cater to lower-income shoppers have noted their increased caution.  But overall spending has held up well, even if some families have to drain their savings or borrow money to keep up.
> The credit rating agency TransUnion says credit card balances expanded in the fourth quarter to $1.15 trillion, $39 billion more than the previous year.
> The growth in spending and GDP comes despite a sharp slowdown in hiring last year.  U.S. employers added just 181,000 jobs in 2025, compared to more than 1.4 million new jobs the year before.
> "That just can't hold," Zandi says.  "If that continues, I think we'll start to see unemployment tick higher, consumers become more cautious, and the economy will struggle. So hopefully we start to see some job growth here in the not too distant future."
> Hiring did pick up in January, with 130,000 jobs added, although most of those jobs were in health care — an industry that tends to add workers in good times and bad.
> GDP was also boosted in the fourth quarter by business investment, especially in artificial intelligence.  Tech companies have been spending huge sums on data centers and other facilities to power the AI boom.
> "That's a bright, shining star that should continue to shine brightly in 2026," Zandi says.
> There are also some indications that investment could spread to other sectors in the coming year.
> "While the A.I. investment boom is expected to continue, recent data suggests early signs of a broader pickup," Wells Fargo economists Tim Quinlan and Shannon Grein wrote in a research note.  "This is occurring amid supportive tax incentives and a growing willingness by firms to finance investment beyond A.I."
> The GOP tax bill passed last summer is designed to encourage business investment by giving companies an immediate tax deduction for that spending, rather than spreading it over a number of years.
> GDP figures seesawed from quarter to quarter last year as a result of big swings in international trade.  The D in GDP stands for "domestic," so imports from other countries are subtracted from the total.  Imports soared early in 2025, as businesses raced to stockpile goods before President Trump's tariffs took effect.  That made GDP look weaker in the early months of the year.  Once the tariffs were in place, imports dropped, making economic growth look stronger.
> For all of 2025, the U.S. ran a trade deficit that was little changed from the year before.
> Government spending declined in the final months of the year, due in part to the six-week federal shutdown.  That subtracted from fourth-quarter growth, although much of that will be made up in the early months of 2026.
> Lackluster residential investment was a drag on the economy throughout last year.
> "One dark spot in the economy that continues to be a problem in 2026 will be housing," Zandi says.  "Affordability is a real issue there. People just can't afford to buy homes at these house prices and mortgage rates."
> Mortgage rates have fallen to just over 6% from nearly 7% a year ago.  But sales of existing homes and construction of new houses remain sluggish.

> International economist Dr Ath Pisalvanich warns Thailand must form a full government by 8 March or risk losing vital trade concessions to the US.
> Thailand must urgently join the "Board of Peace" and stabilise its domestic politics to avoid being sidelined in crucial trade negotiations with the United States, a leading international economist has warned.
> Associate Professor Dr Ath Pisalvanich cautioned that Thailand’s current caretaker status is stalling high-stakes dialogue with the Trump administration.
> While regional neighbours such as Indonesia and Vietnam have already secured significant trade milestones, Thailand’s lack of a fully empowered government threatens its competitive edge in the American market.
> The warning follows a recent breakthrough in Washington, where Indonesia signed a new trade agreement during a Board of Peace summit on 19 February.
> With Vietnam, Cambodia, and India also making headway, and Malaysia and Singapore expected to follow suit, Dr Ath suggests Thailand is fast approaching a strategic disadvantage.
> "The slower the government is formed, the greater the impact on negotiations," Dr Ath stated. "This is an urgent matter affecting exports, foreign investment, and overall economic confidence."
> While a baseline tariff of 19% appears inevitable under current US policy, Dr Ath noted that the "real battle" lies in securing 0% tariff status for specific Thai goods.
> Achieving these exemptions requires deep, technical negotiations that a caretaker administration simply cannot sign off on.
> The Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) remains unable to formalise agreements until a Thai government with full executive authority is established.
> Dr Ath has set a "red line" date of 8 March 2026, arguing that any further delay would be economically "damaging."
> To thaw relations, Dr Ath recommends Thailand join the "Board of Peace" as a gesture of goodwill.
> He argues that the Trump administration increasingly views trade through a political lens, and participation would signal a constructive stance without compromising Thailand’s long-standing neutrality.
> Key sticking points remain, however, particularly regarding the opening of Thai markets to US agricultural imports, such as pork.
> Dr Ath suggests Thailand must identify "bargaining chips" across thousands of product lines to secure the same concessions previously afforded to European partners.
> Beyond diplomacy, the expert urged the state to capitalise on geopolitical shifts.

> When leaders of the European Union arrived in New Delhi as chief guests for India’s Republic Day celebrations in January, the visit marked a significant step in deepening the India-Europe ties.
> It coincided with the formal conclusion of a long-pending
> India–EU trade agreement that had been under negotiation since 2007. This deal is now being described as the “mother of all deals” after European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called it so.
> The description is not just about scale. It is about timing. The agreement brings together two of the world’s largest economic entities when global trade is increasingly witnessing uncertainty, protectionism, and political volatility, particularly emanating from the United States since Donald Trump began his second presidential term in January 2025.
> “This deal did not move for almost twenty years,” said Scott Lucas, Professor of International Politics at the Clinton Institute, University College Dublin.
> “What changed was not the technical details. What changed was the geopolitical context.”
> Formal negotiations between India and the EU began in 2007. For much of the last two decades, progress was slow and often stalled altogether.
> Disagreements over agricultural protections, intellectual property rights, labour and environmental standards, and market access proved difficult to resolve. Domestic political pressures on both sides limited room for compromise.
> What has now been politically agreed comes close to a full free trade agreement. Around 97 per cent of Indian exports to the
> EU and approximately 99 per cent of EU exports to India are expected to face either zero tariffs or significant tariff reductions. Some sensitive sectors have been excluded.
> “The EU has ring-fenced certain agricultural products, such as sugar,” Lucas said.
> “That reflects lessons learned from its controversial trade agreement with South American Mercosur countries, which only narrowly secured approval.”
> The economic scope is substantial. Indian textiles, pharmaceuticals, gems, jewellery, and services are expected to gain easier access to European markets.
> European manufacturers, technology firms, clean energy companies, and specialised agricultural producers gain improved access to India, one of the fastest-growing major economies in the world.
> But according to Lucas, the real importance of the agreement lies beyond trade flows.
> The timing of the India–EU agreement cannot be separated from developments in the United States.
> The return of Donald Trump to a central role in economic decision-making has reintroduced volatility as a defining feature of global trade.
> Tariffs have been imposed, threatened, and adjusted with little predictability. Trade policy has increasingly been framed in personal and transactional terms.
> “For India, it became clear that there was no predictable path with the Trump tariffs for the next three years,” Lucas said, “And for Europe, it became clear that whether tariffs stay at 15 per cent or go higher, you are not going to have a U.S.–European trade alliance that you can rely on.”
> India faced punitive
> tariffs, including penalties linked to its purchase of Russian oil. Despite high-level meetings and public optimism, a comprehensive US–India trade agreement did not materialise.
> Europe, meanwhile, reassessed its own dependence on Washington at a time when transatlantic economic relations were becoming increasingly fragile.
> “Once both sides recognised that this was not temporary uncertainty, a deal that had been discussed for almost twenty years suddenly moved,” Lucas said.
> For New Delhi, the agreement delivers more than economic access. It shows that India’s patience delivers favourable results.
> While a host of countries looked rattled and running for cover after Trump fired his tariff salvos, India said it did not believed in hasty trade deals.
> With
> Trump rocking the trans-Atlantic cooperation boat, sailing smoothly for decades after the Second World War, Europe reached to India to expedite the trade deal hanging fire for about two decades.
> India is now the world’s fourth-largest economy and looks on course to become third-biggest in near future. The Modi government has maintained that its rise as an economic powerhouse and one of the key engines of global economic growth is based on the strong fundamentals of the domestic economy.
> This is what is reflected in the respect that India gets at the global stage. The presence of EU leaders at
> Republic Day Parade, followed by the conclusion of a landmark trade agreement, reinforced that message.
> “This is confirmation that Europe sees India as a partnership it values,” Lucas said.
> The deal places India firmly alongside the United States, China, and the EU as a central actor in the global economic system. It also strengthens India’s negotiating position with other partners by demonstrating that it has alternatives.
> For Europe, the agreement offers diversification. It provides access to a large market at a time when economic ties with both the US and China are under strain.
> Shortly after the India–EU agreement was announced, the United States reacted.
> President Trump stated that tariffs on Indian goods would be reduced and claimed that India would dramatically increase imports of
> US products.
> “India is going to take all of our products,” Trump claimed, hoping that the figure would reach 500 billion dollars. However, the Indian government maintained that the fine prints of the trade deal were still being negotiated.
> Trade analysts quickly noted that the figure far exceeds India’s current imports from the US, which stood at roughly 45 billion dollars last year. India’s official response was notably cautious.
> Prime Minister
> Narendra Modi spoke positively about discussions with Washington but stopped short of confirming any final agreement.
> “He [PM Modi] referred to agreeing to discuss a deal and agreeing to progress,” Lucas noted. “He did not say there was a final deal, because there isn’t one.”
> The distinction matters. While the US has signalled intent, India and the EU have already completed the political core of their agreement.
> As Lucas put it, “Trump is talking the talk. India and the EU are walking the walk.”
> The India–EU agreement does not signal a break between New Delhi and Washington. Instead, it alters the balance of leverage.
> By securing near-free access to the European market, India reduces its vulnerability to pressure from any single partner.
> Tariff threats become less effective when credible alternatives exist. That shift also helps explain why the US moved quickly to reopen trade discussions.
> Europe benefits in similar ways. The deal provides insulation against US unpredictability and reduces reliance on

> Europe is rolling out new initiatives to reduce reliance on US-based payment systems and build a secure, independent payment infrastructure.
> Since US President Donald Trump’s re-election and return to office last year, Washington’s relations with its closest allies in diplomacy, defense and trade have grown increasingly strained, particularly with the EU and the UK.
> Trump has repeatedly urged Europe to increase defense spending and assume greater responsibility, while also threatening tariffs and raising the prospect of annexing Greenland, an autonomous territory under Denmark, further straining transatlantic ties.
> Against this backdrop, European countries are taking concrete steps to strengthen self-sufficiency in payment systems, especially as consumers rely less on cash and more on digital transactions.
> The EU views dependence on foreign-controlled systems as not only an economic vulnerability but also a geopolitical risk, given that Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and Alipay account for most card and mobile payments in Europe and are operated outside the bloc.
> European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde recently stressed that the bloc urgently needs its own digital payment system.
> Although the ECB has been working for years on a digital euro, tangible results have yet to materialize. The digital euro is envisioned as an electronic version of physical cash issued by the ECB.
> Unlike cryptocurrencies, which operate on decentralized blockchain networks, the digital euro would be managed by a central authority.
> Calls are growing across EU member states for faster progress on the digital euro to reduce dependence on US payment providers.
> The European Payments Initiative (EPI), led by major European banks, aims to establish a unified payment infrastructure across the continent and offer a homegrown alternative to Visa and Mastercard.
> The UK is pursuing similar efforts. Senior banking executives are scheduled to hold their first meeting Friday, chaired by Barclays UK CEO Vim Maru, to explore the creation of an alternative system.
> About 95% of card transactions in the UK were processed through Mastercard and Visa, according to 2025 data from the UK’s Payment Systems Regulator (PSR).
> Globally, Visa remains the most widely used payment network, handling 257.5 billion transactions worth $14.2 trillion last year.
> Mastercard processed 160 billion transactions totaling $9.8 trillion in 2024.
> Other major global payment systems include UPI, UnionPay, AliPay, WeChat Pay, SEPA, PIX, PromptPay and PayPal.
> In Türkiye, the domestic Troy payment system has played a central role in advancing fintech independence and strengthening the digital payments ecosystem.
> Troy processed transactions totaling 4.8 trillion Turkish lira ($109.4 billion) last year, marking a 125% year-on-year increase, with its market share reaching 25.3%.

### 4. [Jake Sullivan and Jon Finer on trading the Situation Room for a podcasting booth](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/jake-sullivan-jon-finer-trading-172654840.html)
**Source**: Yahoo | **Date**: 2026-02-20T17:45:00+00:00

> Jake Sullivan and Jon Finer have had as sharp a career pivot since former President Joe Biden left office as Biden himself.
> As national security advisers, they helped set the US’ course through an administration beset by international crises, from the wars in Gaza and Ukraine to the start of the global AI arms race, their decisions shaping the fate of countless lives around the world.
> Now, they host a podcast together.
> It’s been a learning curve. The show, The Long Game, is produced with Vox and debuted last fall. On Semafor’s podcast, Sullivan said he’s had to adjust to sounding “like an actual human being as opposed to a talking points machine.”
> But being on the outside has also forced the two men to reconsider the of the US’ foreign policy, in a way that could resonate with listeners unconcerned with the intricacies of semiconductor sanctions or energy markets.
> “The discipline of having to explain to people why something matters to a broad general audience makes you have to sharpen your thinking about what are American interests, what are the stakes,” Sullivan said. In Washington, “you didn’t have to stop and say, ‘How do I explain this? How do I contextualize this?’”
> That gap — between the true DC wonks and the people who “aren’t marinating in this stuff all day,” as Finer put it — is crucial to understanding President Donald Trump’s way of thinking about foreign relations post-2024.
> “He’s been able to come in and say, ‘Well, why things working this way? Why does the United States do these sorts of things in the world?’” Finer said. “And [Trump] can drive a truck through the gap that we and others have left between what we consider to be just fundamentally important and the appreciation of that by many of the American people.”
> Sullivan and Finer also gave us their review of New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s Taiwan gaffe (or was it?), explained how they avoid accidentally revealing classified information while speaking with guests, and told us what makes them nervous about today’s news ecosystem. You can listen to the full interview on Mixed Signals from Semafor Media wherever you get your podcasts.
> Jake Sullivan: AOC was asked a question about whether the US would come to the defense of Taiwan. This is the hardest question that there is, I think, and we’ve dealt with this up close and personal with the president who we advise, maintain strategic ambiguity. He went out and was just like, “I’m going to answer a hypothetical question with a straight yes or no.” And he said, “Yes.”Max Tani: Welcome to another episode of the Mixed Signals Podcast from us here at Semafor, where we are talking to all of the most important and interesting people shaping our new media age. I’m Max Tani, I’m the media editor here at Semafor, and with me as always is our editor in chief Ben Smith. This week on the show we are talking to Jake Sullivan and Jon Finer. These days, they are lonely podcast hosts just like us. They host a show called The Long Game, which is a podcast about foreign policy for Vox Media, but before that they had slightly more important jobs. Jake was the National Security Advisor for Joe Biden, also worked under Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, and Jon Finer was the Deputy National Security advisor for Joe Biden and also was formerly a journalist for the Washington Post. Had a previous life in media.Ben, you know both Jake and Jon pretty well through your times covering Washington, what are you interested in asking them about on the show today?Ben Smith: Yeah, I think they, and Jake was really running American foreign policy at this moment of just such dramatic change in media and communications, and whether it was the run-up to the Ukraine War or the Israel-Palestine conflict, a lot of what he wound up thinking about I think was media, and then got to watch Donald Trump who has a rather different communication style. But I am very curious what he’s learned and of course why he’s making a podcast. What are we doing here?Max Tani: Yeah, it is pretty interesting going from being one of the people shaping global events and outcomes across the world to doing host-read ads and doing collaborations with shows such as ours. I think that that’s an interesting career trajectory.Ben Smith: Are you saying it’s a downward career trajectory?Max Tani: No, I said it’s interesting. I didn’t say it was downward at all. I think that what we do is very important and very much on par with making global decisions that impact the outcomes of countries all over the globe. That’s why we do this show.Ben Smith: Naturally.Max Tani: So it’s worth mentioning also that because this is a media-focused show, we really wanted to ask Jake and Jon mostly questions about the media. There’s a lot of questions that could be asked about various foreign policy decisions that look good, maybe that don’t look so good, depending on your perspective, and they’ve given interviews and talked about that on other shows. Just for the purposes of this show, we wanted to keep it really focused on media.Well, we have a lot that we want to get to with Jon and Jake, but we have to take a short break and we’ll be right back with the hosts of The Long Game right after this.Ben Smith: Jake, Jon, thank you so much for joining us.Jake Sullivan: Really excited to be here. Thanks for having us.Jon Finer: Yep, great to be here.Ben Smith: Welcome to the podcast trade. It occurs to me that it used to be that kind of officials like you, senior government officials, would leave office and would have some prestigious chair at a think tank or would write a thick biography of Winston Churchill or something. Two years ago this time you were basically running the world, Jake, now you’re hosting a podcast. Is that kind of a letdown?Jake Sullivan: Well, I’ll tell you, it’s a big weight off the shoulders, that’s for sure because I can say just whatever I think without having to worry too much as to whether it conforms to the president’s policy or is going to move markets or anything else. So obviously it’s very different to be a podcaster than to be sitting in the seat as National Security Advisor, but there are some definite advantages. And the medium, as you guys know, gives you an opportunity to really go deeper on issues and also to talk like an actual human being as opposed to a talking points machine. That’s actually been a bit of an adjustment for me especially, but for Jon, I think he can speak for himself to a certain extent as well. And getting to grapple with these issues and talk about them in absolutely plain English actually gives you, I think, a little bit of a healthier perspective on them and maybe will make us better practitioners and policymakers one day in the future.Max Tani: Has the process of being a podcaster, has that given you more respect for your friends in the media who when you’re in a position of power you think, “Gee, these guys are just saying whatever, and they have the freedom to do so.” But now you actually are kind of seeing how hard the technical nuts and bolts are. Those ad reads aren’t as easy as maybe they seemed when you heard them versus when you have to read them yourself?Jon Finer: I’ll just say I actually started my career in the media. I came to government in large part from the experience of having covered what I considered to be either failed or bad policy decisions and got very curious as to how they were made. Mostly I was working overseas. So I think I came in with some inherent sympathy or empathy for what the media tries to do. I then, like every other government official, got massively frustrated when coverage seemed to be inconsistent with what I thought it should be and probably took it out on my reporter friends too often. But yeah, it’s nice to be back on the other side of the firewall here.Jake Sullivan: Can I just say on that point, one of the things that I have a better appreciation for now is that a big part of the job of being a journalist or a commentator and observer is trying to make sense of events, not just the what, but the why and then the what then? Okay, so why should people care about it? And actually that’s kind of seemingly obvious when you’re making policy, but when you’re on the outside trying to interpret policy decisions, it’s more challenging and actually is a really interesting intellectual exercise that is something that we’ve come to over the course of the weeks we’ve been doing the pod.Max Tani: You mentioned a second ago that it’s kind of changed your thinking on some of these issues. Obviously these are things that you’ve thought very, very deeply about, but can you think of any specific examples where you’ve changed your mind now having to be an interpreter rather than a player in some of these decisions? Are there any specific examples that come to mind here?Jake Sullivan: I guess for me it’s a little bit less, have I flipped on a policy issue, like gone from believing X to believing Y, and more that the discipline of having to explain to people why something matters to a broad general audience makes you have to sharpen your thinking about what are American interests? What are the stakes? How do I make this real and not just something that’s kind of received wisdom or natural muscle memory? And we’ve done pods on everything from the use of US military force and how do we sharpen our thinking about what are the criteria for when we should and should not do that? To, US China relations, and how do you explain to people why do these semiconductor export controls actually matter. We just kind of were going with that in a way when we were in government, not just riding a wave or whatever, but you didn’t have to stop and say, “How do I explain this? How do I contextualize this? And in so doing, am I really pressure testing the ideas and the priorities that we’re putting on things?”Jon Finer: I think it’s actually an exercise that makes for better policy or will help us make for better policy, or at least policy communications going forward. Because one thing that people like us, I think have not done as effectively as we should have, not just over recent years, but over recent decades, is stop taking for granted that people in the United States see things the way we do, or understand the importance of things the way we do, especially things going on in the world.And one of the things that I think the Trump phenomenon has taken advantage of is a disconnect between people making policy and people who are digesting policy just out in the world who aren’t marinating in this stuff all day every day. And so he’s been able to come in and say, “Well, why are things working this way? Why does the United States do these sorts of things in the world? Why does the United States care about things like these abstract terms like the international system or alliances? And can drive a truck through the gap that we and others have left between what we consider to be just fundamentally important and the appreciation of that by many of the American people?” So it does kind of force us to be disciplined about explaining why these things matter.Max Tani: Yeah. Is that the reason why you guys decided to do this? And also, just to take a step back, how did you decide to do this podcast together? Did Vox approach you guys, had you guys thought during your time in office, man, I can’t wait to get out of here so I can do a podcast explaining foreign policy from the outside to people? How did this actually come about?Jake Sullivan: Well, Max, when I was a young man growing up in Minneapolis, Minnesota, I thought one day I will be a podcaster. I saw it coming long before.Max Tani: Everybody does.Jake Sullivan: Actually. I don’t know if Jon has the exact same recollection I do, but after we left, like a week, 10 days after we left, we went skiing out west with some friends and then we went hiking in Bryce Canyon, in winter hiking, late January, early February, and it was on that hike that we were like, “Hey, maybe we should do a podcast.” We kind of talked through A; that we thought there was room for a foreign policy podcast that wasn’t about hot takes and wasn’t super partisan, but that was actually just trying to explain the why. It put things in context. And the title of the podcast is The Long Game, talk about a longer-term view, a longer-term perspective.So we both thought there’s a place for this and we thought this will be fun and we’ll learn a lot and stay fresh on these issues along the way. So normally when you cook things up on hiking trips, you don’t actually do them, but somehow we ended up doing it. Do I have that about right, Jon, or is my memory playing tricks on me?Jon Finer: I think you do. I think the only thing I’d add is somewhat serendipitously, we got outreach from someone saying that Vox was actually looking for content in this space and had initial conversation, and I think they agreed with the theory of the case that we were cooking up on this hike, and the rest is at least recent history.Max Tani: Who is listening to the show so far? Are you hearing from foreign officials? Are you hearing from diplomats, people you used to work with directly? Who are you guys hearing from? What’s the reception been?Jon Finer: So I think both of us have had the experience of bumping into people as we move around the world or around the country doing other things that we do and having them walk up to us and say, “Hey, I’ve been listening to your podcast.” And either, “Here’s some constructive feedback,” or, “I like this or I don’t like this.” All of which is great and totally welcome. Now, I think it’s also the kind of thing people say when they see you and they know that you have a podcast, whether they’re actually listening to every episode, I don’t try to verify.Max Tani: Everybody who comes up to me and who compliments me on the podcast is a full-time listener and they’ve listened to all of the episodes.Jon Finer: By the way, Max, we love your podcast.Max Tani: Thank you. Yes. You guys are huge longterm fans.Jake Sullivan: We’re faithful listeners every week.Max Tani: Yes, exactly.Jake Sullivan: Huge fans.Jon Finer: But I think it actually is, you’ve hit on something that we’re very curious about. We don’t spend every day scrutinizing the data and the numbers, we’re trying to get the content and do as well as we can at this. And I am kind of curious beyond the people who walk up to us or email us or text us, who out there is actually paying attention? I don’t have a particularly granular understanding. Other than I think our goal is to reach beyond the people who we see interact with, used to work with every day, to others maybe who have not been as much plugged into this content. And if we can do that, then I would consider it a success.Jake Sullivan: Yeah, we definitely hear from current and former government officials around the world. We also just get a mailbag. We hear from people across the US, parts of Europe, other places, people writing in, responding to things, asking questions, suggesting topics and the like. We keep thinking about doing a mailbag segment where we take some of the listener questions and kind of go through them. We haven’t done that yet, but at some point here we will. But that’s kind of an unscientific way of getting some sense. And I think there’s a lot of listeners who follow foreign policy digest the major newspapers, the international sections of the major newspapers, but aren’t like living it day to day who are just looking for decent content on the topic. And that’s the audience we’re going to continue to try to grow.Ben Smith: Your sort of description of why you’re doing this, you’re delivering that with a certain amount of discipline. But it occurs to me that during the Biden years, Jake, I think you in particular had this idea and talked about rooting foreign policy and the issues of the middle class, rooting foreign policy and domestic issues in some sense, and I think, I don’t know if you would accept this, but I think that fundamentally kind of didn’t land. It sounds like that’s some of what you’re reworking now and thinking about, is that right?Jake Sullivan: Well, look, I do think that kind of across the board as the communications and information environment changes, finding a way to make real, the kinds of issues we work on for everyday people, for working people in this country is not an easy thing, and I’m not going to claim that our podcast is going to solve that. But giving us the opportunity to test out how to think about, talk about frame issues, I think is an important part of being someone operating in this space. It’s not good enough just to think about the ideas. You’ve got to try on a constant basis to speak about them, to communicate about them, in a way that can reach a broader audience. Because ultimately trying to get greater buy-in or greater understanding for what the United States is doing in the world is really important.I do agree with you that on some issues it was hard to break through or communicate. On other issues, I disagree a little. I think Ukraine is a fascinating example of a case where for people from across all walks of life, all corners of the country, folks instinctively, intuitively got it. And actually, the media pretty consistently underestimated the American people on this. They kept saying, “Oh, the American people are going to abandon Ukraine. They’re no longer going to want to support it. They don’t want to fund it,” et cetera. But even in the Trump administration support for Ukraine and support for the United States providing aid to Ukraine has stood up pretty well on a bipartisan basis. So I agree with you to a certain extent it didn’t land, but I think that was more differentiated across issue areas.Jon Finer: I personally am pretty surprised by the degree to which the Ukraine issue has landed with the American people and stayed consistent and front of mind. I started my career covering a war that the United States was fighting in as a journalist, the Iraq war, and I found during that time when I came home, trying to get people to talk about what was happening over there was often pulling teeth. People just did not want to engage on it, in part because I think it was a highly unpleasant issue, in part because I think there were real doubts about whether the purpose, the morality of the actual decision to go in was the right one.On Russia, Ukraine. I think part of what I underestimated is how people are drawn to a narrative where there is a clear perpetrator and a clear victim as is the case in this conflict, and it made it much more digestible to the average person as opposed to the complexities of weapons of mass destruction or energy markets or some of these issues that have led to conflicts in the past, even though we were not a direct combatant, they stayed on it.Max Tani: Because this is a media show, I want to ask a specific media question here. There was one thing that happened early in the war that you guys did that I think was seen by a lot of folks here as savvy, which is that you declassified a lot of these Russian disinformation efforts. You put them out there before they were able to kind fester and take hold as kind of conspiracy theories. It showed a kind of interesting savviness about the ways in which disinformation and new media worked. But I’m kind of curious how much time you spent thinking about media and the ways that foreign media was shaping some of the things that were happening abroad. How often was the interpretations of US actions in foreign media being factored into you guys’ decision-making processes?Jake Sullivan: Well, particularly when it came to Russia, it was very front of mind because for Putin owning the information space, being able to define what was happening, was critical to his strategy. And what he wanted to be able to do in the Ukraine context was say Ukraine was the aggressor, Russia was under attack. Ukraine was starting the war and Russia had no choice. They got dragged in. And so to defeat that strategy, it became essential for us to essentially narrate the war, basically to say, Putin is planning to invade. He’s planning to do it in a couple months time. He’s going to throw up all this chaff about how it’s the Ukrainians provoking him. That’s all going to be BS. And we needed to lay all that down in advance so that Putin could not successfully own the narrative of that war.And then equally in other contexts, we learned a lot from that. In dealing with the US-China relationship. China actually puts a lot of energy and effort into trying to shape the global narrative. One example of that in this whole question of semiconductor export controls, they really want to sell the story, this can’t work. They keep seeding in the western press that China’s had another big breakthrough, which just once again proves that the export controls don’t work at all. Meanwhile, their diplomats are demanding that we lift the controls, which suggests they are working, and there’s a lot of evidence to suggest they are. That’s another area where I think the centrality of being able to be engaged publicly in a back and forth in the global media has an impact on the actual policymaking and the actual shape of the strategy that great powers are undertaking. I think that that is going to be a feature of the landscape going forward, and anyone sitting in the National Security Council is going to have to think a lot about that.Jon Finer: Normally in a crisis, something happens in the world and then you are responding to the thing that happens, some bad act somewhere. This time Jake and I walked in one morning and the first page of the President’s Daily Brief, which sits on our desk every day when we arrive, basically that the intelligence community believed that Russia was very likely to invade Ukraine. And we were like, “Huh, that’s pretty big deal. And it would’ve been nice if somebody maybe given us a call to say this was coming, but it looks like we’ve got a few months and we’ve got to figure out what to do.” And so that was the advantage. The disadvantage was when we went around and started talking to our friends out in the world, by the way, including our friends in Ukraine-Jake Sullivan: The Ukrainians, yeah.Jon Finer: ... nobody really believed that we were right. And there’s a checkered history of US intelligence predictions not always playing out the way we say. And so we were up against a pretty steep hill to convince our partners, our allies, the Ukrainians themselves and the public, that this was likely to happen. And it led to us pushing the envelope a bit with the intelligence community, but we did it in a way that was hand in glove with them, rigorous in the sense of protecting the sources of that material and the methods by which we obtained it, because obviously you don’t want to just undo your ability to collect intelligence by revealing this stuff. And it allowed us to be ready.And the Ukrainians ultimately, once they were persuaded to be ready when the war began, because we surged a bunch of weapons in that they could use to defend themselves right off the bat. And we got our European partners ready to impose sanctions on Russia, not months after the first day of the invasion, but days after. And had we not been able to kind of present them with this pretty ironclad information, Russia would’ve been able to do this with impunity in the early days, which couldn’t.Ben Smith: One of the aspects of the Israel-Palestine conflict is the media war. How much do you think the public should accept Israeli government claims about the conflict? And on the other side, how much should they accept Palestinian claims? I saw there was recently a report that the Israelis now accept the Palestinian death count.Jon Finer: I guess my general view is when a country is a combatant in a war, it’s incentivized to present facts that are advantageous to its position. That’s true of any country, including by the way the United States in the wars that we’ve fought.So I think a good general proposition is not to take any presentation at face value to sort of seek independent corroboration, whether from media, from other governments, from international organizations. And so, I think that is true of government of Israel. It’s frankly true of the United States government in the current moment, given some of the presentations that are being made about world affairs, whether in the Munich Security Conference recently or going forward. So I think that’s just a good general rule as a consumer of media to follow.Jake Sullivan: And just to follow up on that, Jon started his career, he mentioned he was in media as a war correspondent, actually riding in with the US military into Iraq in 2003. And the US embeds journalists when we send forces into combat, whether it’s in Iraq or Afghanistan or elsewhere, and those journalists are able to get firsthand accounts of things, see them and report on them.As things stand today, I still believe it’s the case that Israel’s not allowing foreign journalists into Gaza. And that is a significant problem because it means that you’re not getting independent eyes and ears on the ground there. And to Jon’s point, that’s true of any combat in a war, whether it’s Israel or Hamas. And the lack of access for international journalists to Gaza I think is setting back the cause of transparency and we should be able to get the full picture by having independent media in there, being able to report on it.Max Tani: On the one hand, we’ve seen a lot of investment in Israeli propaganda, particularly on social media. We know that there’s been paid influencers in the United States who’ve carried some of this. And then on the flip side, we’re curious how important Al Jazeera remains as far as supporting the Palestinian side. How did you guys think about both of those kind of entities here?Jake Sullivan: I think there’s a larger issue here that even goes beyond this particular very tragic conflict where you’re seeing a lot of different governments around the world think about how they invest in sources of, for lack of a better term, propaganda. And I think we have seen the Israeli government take steps to try to press its narrative through a whole bunch of different channels. And we have seen supporters of the Palestinian cause, and Al Jazeera is, I think, an example of an outlet that makes no bones about its perspective in this war, what it thinks of Israel, what it thinks of the Palestinian cause, and I think has had a huge impact on the narrative because of its ability both to generate images and have access that a lot of other people don’t get. And that goes way beyond just this conflict for Al Jazeera.I think Al Jazeera remains an incredibly potent platform to drive a variety of narratives across the region, some of which upset other countries in the region because of course it’s based in Qatar, and Qatar has had its challenges with some of its neighbors. But this is something in the US government we had to watch, but we had to watch it not just with respect to these countries and these players, but with many others as well. And going back to previous administrations, there have been efforts to engage the Qatari government on Al Jazeera as it relates to various US policy actions. We didn’t really, in our administration, have that kind of engagement. We weren’t trying to shape or change Al Jazeera’s coverage in any way, but we were certainly cognizant of it as we watched the information environment unfold around the set of overlapping conflicts across the Middle East.Max Tani: You guys were some of the most visible faces and important people in the room for some of these discussions. I guess, for better or for worse, do you feel like some of the policy decisions that you guys made have closed some doors to you guys in terms of your future within the Democratic Party?Jon Finer: Well, look. I guess what I’d say is, this issue is unique in some ways. In that, you know, close watchers of it, close observers of it, often take an extremely zero-sum kind of binary, almost, approach. It’s either this or it’s that, and there’s no Venn diagram of the two views.
> There aren’t many issues we work on that are like that. So finding common ground among people who believe, for example, our administration was — and there are people like this, even though it’s maybe a bit less in some of the media discourse — too harsh in criticizing the Israelis, withholding certain capabilities from them. And then the people who I think are at least the majority of the people who I hear from who believe the opposite, essentially. That we gave the Israelis too much of a free hand and a free pass during that conflict. There is not going to be any common ground among those people, and that issue is still, I think, playing out in the discourse, both broadly across the country and as you kind of hinted, inside the Democratic Party.I think Jake and I each have views, sort of decision by decision and moment by moment. Did we get this right? Did we get that right? But this is going to be a big issue that I think the party is going to be wrestling with. Maybe less in terms of the midterms, because the midterms tend to be about a bunch of different micro races playing out across the country. But certainly, as we go into choosing a candidate in 2028, this is going to be one of the issues that’s on the agenda.
> How did that candidate view what happened on October 7, and in the aftermath of that, is going to be one of the issues that a Democratic electorate will assess, and frankly, should assess.
> How that impacts me personally, I suspect Jake would feel the same way, is not nearly as high a priority for me now as helping figure out what the party should be for going into, ideally, the next time that we’re in power, which I hope is soon, whether that includes us or not.
> Jake Sullivan: I couldn’t say it any better, and, just to put a fine point on it, I think the key question is what lessons to take away from the last three years when it comes to policy towards Israel and Gaza. The opportunity to go back through a set of decisions and look hard at them with the benefit of hindsight, and then make judgments about where the party, where the country should go from here on these issues.
> I think Jon and I will both participate in the conversation, and many, many other people will as well. And what kind of impact that has on me, or him, or anyone else, that’s not a top priority.
> Max Tani: Well, we have a lot that we want to get to with Jon and Jake, but we have to take a short break and we’ll be right back right after this.A lot of the things that we’ve been talking about here are a little bit backward looking. I want to kind of look forward. One thing people saw during the 2016 election and afterwards was the power of digital misinformation as kind of a political and a state tool. The new force in information, the major player is obviously AI and LLMs that are increasingly a part of people’s daily lives and how they get their information. How do you see LLMs shaping the information people get and how is the US government going to try and reckon with the fact that most people across the world are probably going to be getting their information from AI within the next 10 or 15 years?Jon Finer: I think one thing probably everybody has experienced is just the deluge of AI generated content in their various feeds wherever they consume information. And that creates a couple of problems. One obviously is a disinformation problem. Some of this is just false or information generated to push a particular viewpoint, even if it’s not grounded in fact. But it also exacerbates another problem, which is people already come to this AI phenomenon with a deep skepticism about facts that they’re presented by media. And now you often see even content that’s generated by established news organizations, if you look at the comments underneath it, you have people saying, “Oh, this is clearly AI, or this is clearly fake news,” or whatever.And so I think we have a societal problem that is we no longer have a common factual basis on which we develop our opinions and analyze the issues we face. We used to always have wildly divergent views about policy or things that were happening in the country, but at least we started from a common set of basic facts. We don’t even have that factual foundation anymore. And so on the one hand, while AI enables people to obtain all manner of information that was not available to them previously, I worry that it is going to deeply make even more difficult, this challenge of being able to function as a cohesive society because people disagree even about the basic building blocks of information that they are presented. I think that’s going to make things harder, not easier.Jake Sullivan: And Max, one of the things in the Biden administration that we pursued with the major AI companies, US companies, was a set of voluntary commitments that they would make, one of which had to do with watermarking, which is essentially to take any piece of digital content and say, this is human-generated versus this is AI-generated. There’s been pretty uneven implementation of that, but I think we are going to have to come up with technical tools to help consumers distinguish between that which is real and that which is AI-generated, especially since the AI-generated stuff is so damn good, both video and audio as well as the more traditional kind of text-based digital content.So technical solutions are going to have to be a part of this, and figuring out how to play defense against what will be a deluge of this stuff coming forward. And by the way, not just foreign state directed, I mean this is going to be bubbling up in terms of trying to shape the political discourse in the United States. And there’s a real question as to whether democracies, which do have to be rooted in a common base of information and facts, as Jon just said, are going to be able to withstand this flood. I think we can, but it’s going to require some pretty creative work, both on the technical side and just in terms of public education and resilience to be able to deal with what is, I think a really severe systemic challenge.Max Tani: I want to shift to some stuff in the news today, which we’re really curious about. I’m sure you guys were paying close attention to the panels and some of the speaking that was happening over the weekend at the Munich Security Conference. AOC’s comments were pretty highly scrutinized. I’m really curious what you made of in particular Newsom and AOC speaking at Munich, and of course also separately what you thought about Secretary of State, Marco Rubio taking a slightly different tone than JD Vance when he appeared at Munich last year. I realize that those are two to three very specific questions. You guys are pretty good at this, your podcast pros, I’d be curious to hear you on both of those.Jake Sullivan: Well, I’ll make one observation. AOC was asked a question about whether the US would come to the defense of Taiwan. This is the hardest question that there is, I think... And we’ve dealt with this up close and personal with the president who we advise maintain strategic ambiguity. He went out and was just like, “I’m going to answer a hypothetical question with a straight yes or no.” And he said, “Yes.”So as far as I’m concerned that Taiwan question is almost necessarily going to generate an answer that people can pick at because the right answer is some mashup of ambiguous statements that kind of leave you nowhere. So that stood out to me. It was a flashback to many, many times sitting in rooms where that question was posed to the President of the United States, and he would continually say, “Yes, we’re going to fight them,” and then want to go out and say, “Our policy hasn’t changed,” and so forth.I thought on Rubio’s speech that there was a big disconnect, interestingly between in the room him getting a standing ovation, and I think people actually appreciated a civil tone, if nothing more, especially after what JD Vance did last year. And then immediately the way in which I think the European press covered the speech, which was essentially this is a velvet glove over the same policy that is still a policy that fundamentally disrespects and undermines the transatlantic relationship and is very aggressive towards Europe.And I think that that’s fair. And to double down on that message, Rubio went on to stand next to Viktor Orban and basically endorse his candidacy in Hungary to be reelected as Prime Minister. So it was unmistakable that Rubio was saying things in a pleasant way, but fundamentally was reasserting a quite hostile policy from the Trump administration to Europe. And the Europeans are saying basically, “We have to take what you’re saying at face value and de-risk from the United States, hedge against the United States.” And I think that that is really problematic because I think that that relationship, that transatlantic relationship has been a huge asset to the United States.Jon Finer: The way I think about the Rubio speech, which was received exactly as Jake described it, is he’s almost the designated driver of the Trump administration. He’s not smashing the guardrails or sort of swerving down the lane, but he’s going to the same destination as JD Vance and Donald Trump. And so, there was nothing other than the tone, the respectful presentation. He didn’t just walk in and track mud on the floor of their house. He was polite, but nothing in the substance of the presentation that should give Europeans much reassurance. And if anything, it ratifies what they were already, I think completely convinced about, which is they just cannot depend on the United States for the foreseeable future.And I think AOC deserves a lot of credit, frankly. I mean, for presenting a coherent worldview in terms of foreign policy and a set of objectives that she will stand for on the world stage or as a candidate for some higher office if she chooses to do that. Most people come and try to just memorize a few safe answers to these questions and get out looking like they’ve at least learned the catechism of foreign affairs, and she tried to do more than that. And whether people like that worldview or dislike that worldview, we may find out going forward, but she took a bigger swing than most people do for their first time in these settings.Ben Smith: Who do you think are heavyweights on foreign policy in the 2028 field, and ultimately, does that even matter anymore?Jon Finer: I would just start off by saying, I think Jake and I have worked for two presidents, one of whom I think he would acknowledge came to the job without a ton of foreign policy experience, Barack Obama. The other, Joe Biden, who probably came to the office with more foreign policy experience maybe than any other president, at least in recent history. You could make the case about George H.W. Bush having been pretty steeped in foreign policy when he became president too. So totally different experiences in that way.And I will say for Barack Obama, quite quickly, he became one of the most fluent, if not the most fluent person in all of the issues the country faced in the discussions that took place with his national security team. He was an incredibly quick study and developed a very coherent theory of the world and tried to take on big challenges in a significant way that was not necessarily what you might expect for somebody who was new to all this. I’m sort of dodging, I guess, who’s best in these, not.Max Tani: I was going to say that’s a very diplomatic answer. Yeah, exactly. You don’t have to do this anymore.Jake Sullivan: I’ll take any of them over what we got, so that’s that.Jon Finer: Hear, hear.Max Tani: All right, fair enough. Yes, very artful dodges. One of the things that I think really works in the format that you guys are doing, this works both for political and policy podcasts and also for sports podcasts, is hosts who have done the job before interviewing people, but then kind of using that as an opportunity to get into really interesting stories or things that have happened, using the kind of personal experience to reveal interesting kind of information. I was thinking about that when I was listening to you guys’ episode that you did with Evan Osnos on China.Do you worry that there’s a potential that you guys might reveal information that you’re not supposed to reveal? Are there still things that you kind can’t talk about that maybe you want to talk about because you’re doing a podcast about the things that are happening in the world?Ben Smith: Are you at risk now on a podcast of revealing something that maybe you shouldn’t?Jake Sullivan: Definitely. I mean, because we know a lot of stuff that is still considered classified information. Of course, we wouldn’t reveal any of that. So we have to be careful about policing that line between what’s classified and what’s not classified. But of course, we had a lot of practice with that in our time in government, knowing what we’re allowed to say publicly and what we’re not allowed to say publicly. But that remains something that we have to think about.Also, Max, it’s interesting, it does take, we’ve now done I think a dozen episodes or close to a dozen episodes, and I would say we’re not at 100% of being purely human yet of being like, hey, we’re just going to tell you how it is. Because beyond the classified filter, there’s still the kind of public official filter of how to say things the right way. And we are just trying to tear that. We’ll keep the classified filter up like absolutely four square, but this other filter I think we need to tear down, and we’re getting better every episode, by, I don’t know, the end of this year, I think we’re just going to be really letting it rip. But that has been an interesting adjustment for sure. That is something new. That is uncharted territory, talking like a pure, unadulterated human being.Max Tani: Important part of podcast success is letting it rip. But Jake, speaking of someone was telling us in the prep for this interview that you are a rumored Senate candidate in Minnesota. Is this going to be a short-lived podcast stint? Are you running there? Is that a real thing? This was in our show notes, so it’s important that we ask.Jake Sullivan: I really wonder where that came from in your show notes, because the answer to that question is definitely no. And that’s not a... I’m just happy doing what I’m doing podcasting right now while I explore it. No, I’m not running for Senate in Minnesota.Jon Finer: And now that Jake’s not running, I’m going to have to look hard at it.Max Tani: Are you going to have to take a hard look at it? Yes, exactly. I think that’s a good place for us to wrap it. So now that you guys feel comfortable encroaching on our territory as podcast hosts, maybe I should put myself up for National Security Director or Deputy National Security Chief.Jon Finer: Let us know if you need a reference. Happy to provide.Max Tani: Exactly. Thanks again.Ben, what did you think about the overall thrust that they had of this idea that Americans need foreign policy demystified for them and that the media space at the moment isn’t doing a particularly good job at explaining these key pillars of foreign policy? I mean, they basically mentioned during the episode that American’s inability to understand fully what was going on in the world was one of the reasons why Donald Trump was able to, as they put it, drive a truck through the way that the world was operating, and American’s understanding of foreign affairs and why things operate the way that they do in this kind of global system. What did you think about that argument? Did that ring true to you?Ben Smith: Yeah, I mean, I think that they are doing these podcasts in a way like the way we are, sort of learning as they go, using this podcast to try to figure out a media space that I think at a very high geopolitical level, Jake and Jon played extremely effectively against the Russians in particular, but in an American tactical political level, really didn’t work. They had this idea we’re going to explain foreign policy in a way that makes sense to middle class. Maybe Joe Biden couldn’t really explain much at that point, but that didn’t work.And Trump came in and did actually explain foreign policy in a way that made sense to people, totally personalizes it. It’s about his relationships with other leaders and then has meetings in public that typically would’ve taken place in private. Like the Ukraine breakdown with Zelenskyy wasn’t something that happened behind the scenes and we learned about. That happened on camera. And there’s this way in which Trump is operating totally in public that I think has allowed him to explain what he’s doing abroad. I’m not sure that’s made it popular, but it’s made it clearer and it’s drawn attention in a way that I think the Biden administration didn’t really succeed in doing.Max Tani: One of the things that we wanted to ask about was this kind of battle over information related to the war in Gaza. Whether on one side you had the Israeli state essentially propaganda, and on the other side you had kind of this interest-based media. Particularly, we asked about Al Jazeera as an example of that. But what did you think about the ways that the Biden administration and those guys were thinking about handling information and how that was shaping public perceptions of the war of what was going on over there?Ben Smith: My own perception is that they were very focused on communicating to the Israeli public and to Benjamin Netanyahu and really kind of lost the information war at home there. And then meanwhile, the Israeli and Palestinian sides via Al Jazeera, via the Israeli government, via a network of people on Twitter, took the whole narrative away from them. I did think the thing I want to the, that Jake said is true. The fact that the Israelis don’t allow independent journalists to Gaza means that we don’t have independent voices telling us what’s going on, and that’s just a real issue.Max Tani: It really strikes me that both Jon and Jake understand foreign policy quite well, but one of the things that they are actively puzzling through with this podcast and puzzling through in the aftermath of their departure from the White House is how to communicate about foreign policy in a new information landscape and how to use communication as kind of a state tool. And that I think part of the reason why they’re not writing books or necessarily becoming contributors on television is that they are trying to feel like what it is on the other side, being the communicators being part of this kind of new media ecosystem. And I think in some ways that’s teaching them how to kind of shape US foreign policy going forward, should either of them be involved in any administrations in the future.Ben Smith: I think that’s a great point. And to that point, I mean, you asked, I thought, a kind of impolite question about the way in which Gaza I think will hang over everybody from the Biden administration. You covered the White House, you covered these guys. How do you think the Biden approach to that war is going to play in 2028? Are there going to be people who are disqualified from running for president because they were too pro-Israel?Max Tani: I think that Jon said it pretty well. This is going to be an issue that is going to hang over the 2028 Democratic primary, and where various candidates stood on this issue is going to be something that matters to a slice of the Democratic electorate. And so that was the reason why we wanted to kind of ask them. Both of those guys are some of the most senior foreign policy officials in democratic politics, and it is an open question about whether they’ll be involved in future administrations given the controversy around this and the sensitivity around this particular topic.Ben Smith: Yeah, no, I think it was a good question. I guess my own experience is that once folks get into that little circle of people who’ve had that level of experience, they come back, partly just by definition, there’s so few people who have the experience. So I suspect those guys won’t be podcasters for life. Look forward to their roles in the AOC administration.Max Tani: And that is it for us this week.

### 5. [Trump addresses press after Supreme Court strikes down his sweeping tariffs](https://www.news4jax.com/news/politics/2026/02/20/the-latest-supreme-court-strikes-down-trumps-tariffs-upending-central-plank-of-economic-agenda/)
**Source**: News4JAX | **Date**: 2026-02-20T21:47:00+00:00

> The Supreme Court struck down President Donald Trump’s far-reaching global tariffs in a 6-3 decision on Friday, handing him a stinging loss on an issue crucial to his economic agenda.
> Furious about the defeat, Trump said he will impose a global 10% tariff as an alternative while pressing his trade policies by other means. The new tariffs would come under a law that restricts them to 150 days.
> He made that announcement after lashing out at the Supreme Court for striking down much of his sweeping tariff infrastructure as an illegal use of emergency power. Trump said he was “absolutely ashamed” of justices who voted to strike down his tariffs and called the ruling “deeply disappointing.”
> “Their decision is incorrect,” he said. “But it doesn’t matter because we have very powerful alternatives.”
> Tennessee Soybean Association urges Trump to not impose more tariffs
> The Tennessee Soybean Association, a state chapter of the national association, called on Trump to avoid using other authority to impose tariffs on agricultural products.
> “We recognize and respect the complex geopolitical issues the Trump Administration is navigating around the globe; however, agricultural inputs like crop protection chemicals, farm equipment, seeds, and fuel are vital to our soybean growers here in Tennessee,” Jay Yeargin, president of the Tennessee Soybean Association, said in a statement. “With the economic crisis farmers are facing right now, there is little room for higher input costs, especially if we wish to compete in the global market.”
> Illinois governor demands refund, sends invoice marked ‘Past Due—Delinquent’
> Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker is demanding a refund. The Democrat’s gubernatorial campaign on Friday released a letter addressed to Trump — with an attached invoice for $8.68 billion — following the Supreme Court’s ruling on tariffs.
> “Your tariff taxes wreaked havoc on farmers, enraged our allies and sent grocery prices through the roof,” wrote Pritzker, who’s eyed as a 2028 presidential contender and has repeatedly sparred with the president. “This morning, your hand-picked Supreme Court justices notified you that they are also unconstitutional.”
> The invoice, marked “Past Due—Delinquent,” sets the tariffs’ cost at $1,700 for each of the state’s 5.11 million households, a total of $8,679,261,600.
> Pritzker says failure to pay will elicit “further action.”
> Reaction from Europe focuses on renewed upheaval, confusion
> The initial reaction from Europe focused on renewed upheaval and confusion regarding costs facing businesses exporting to the US.
> The European Commission had reached a deal with the Trump administration capping tariffs on European imports at 15%. The deal gave businesses certainty that helped them plan, a factor credited with helping the 21 countries that use the euro currency skirt a recession last year.
> “Uncertainty remains high for German enterprises doing business in the US,” said the German Chamber of Commerce and Industry. “Because there are other instruments for trade limitations in the hands of the US administration that German companies must prepare themselves for.”
> Trump could resort to laws permitting more targeted tariffs that could hit pharmaceuticals, chemicals and auto parts, said Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING bank: “Europe should not be mistaken, this ruling will not bring relief. ... The legal authority may be different, but the economic impact could be identical or worse.”
> Brazil celebrates US Supreme Court’s decision
> Brazil will continue trade negotiations with the United States regardless.
> The South American nation’s leading negotiator on the topic, Vice President and Industry Minister Geraldo Alckmin, told journalists in Brasilia on Friday that the ruling “strengthens the trade negotiations between his country and the U.S.,” but added the two “will carry on with their dialogue” on the tariffs.
> “The 10% (tariffs imposed later) are for all. We don’t lose competitiveness if it is 10% for all. What was happening was Brazil getting a 40% tariff that no one else had,” the Brazilian said. Alckmin added Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and Trump are expected to further discuss trade during a meeting sometime in March.
> Michigan business owner says prices will have to be raised
> Linda Schlesinger-Wagner, owner of Birmingham, Michigan-based skinnytees, didn’t get overly excited after initially hearing about the Supreme Court’s ruling.
> “He’ll find some way to get around this,” Schlesinger-Wagner said.
> Schlesinger-Wagner estimates that the tariffs, so far, have cost her women’s apparel business about a $1 million. She says 100% of her garments come from China.
> “I don’t know what I’m going to do,” she said Friday afternoon. “I never raised my prices. Now, with another 10% I’m going to be forced to.”
> The tariffs have “affected every business I know because everybody gets something from somewhere,” Schlesinger-Wagner added. “We’re supposed to be global unity. He’s just alienating everyone from us.”
> Argentina’s VP says the Supreme Court decision is a blow to production policies
> In Argentina, a key South American ally of the Trump administration, Vice President Victoria Villarruel characterized the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision as “a blow to production policies and business establishment.”
> While serving as acting President during Javier Milei’s trip to the inaugural Board of Peace meeting in Washington, Villarruel argued on X that “the total and unrestricted opening of imports only favors dependence on China.”
> She warned that such policies would deepen “economic and social emergencies.”
> The Vice President framed the conflict as a choice between “Nationalism or Globalism.”
> Steelmakers’ groups say key tariff is unaffected by court ruling
> Steelmaking industry groups say the Supreme Court’s decision on Friday didn’t affect tariffs on steel imports put in place under national security provisions.
> The tariffs on foreign steel were enforced under a law that grants the president broad authority to address threats to U.S. national security, Kevin Dempsey, president and CEO of the American Iron and Steel Institute, said in a statement.
> The Steel Manufacturers Association’s president, Philip Bell, said the Supreme Court decision doesn’t undo the steel tariff that “is revitalizing the American steel industry, strengthened our national security, and fueled the creation of high-quality American jobs.”
> Mexico’s economy secretary on tariffs: ‘I don’t know how it will end’
> Mexican Economy Secretary Marcelo Ebrard, speaking at a public event in parallel with Trump’s comments, was cautious about the effects of the Supreme Court’s decision.
> “I don’t know how it will end,” he said, adding: “In the case of Mexico, only some of the tariff measures have to do with that legal provision, others do not.”
> However, he said that Mexico’s government still plans to move forward this year depending on the “strength of trade between the two countries,” and recalled that just a year ago, Mexico was facing a 25% tariff on all its exports, “and today, as you can see, most of my exports do not have those burdens.”
> It remains unclear what Trump’s announcement of 10% generalized tariffs will mean for Mexico’s economy, but it’s among the countries that could be hit the hardest as the U.S. and Mexican economies are inextricably intertwined from decades of free trade.
> Ebrard and other officials have been locked in negotiations with the Trump administration for months in an effort to offset wider tariffs.
> Bessent says he was ‘a little surprised’ by the decision
> “I was a little surprised because I was in the Supreme Court hearing,” Bessent said when asked about his reaction to the SCOTUS decision at the Economic Club of Dallas, Friday. “I think what we saw was just a very narrowing of the definition of the president’s ability to use IEPPA powers.”
> He added, “the look forward — no one should expect that tariff revenue will go down.”
> “The total amount of revenue that Treasury will collect this year will be little changed”
> Bessent says alternative tariff plan will lead to ‘virtually unchanged tariff revenue’ in 2026
> Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says the Supreme Court “did not rule against President Trump’s tariffs,” rather “Six Justices simply ruled that IEEPA authorities cannot be used to raise even one dollar of revenue.”
> In a prepared speech to the Economic Club of Dallas delivered Friday afternoon, Bessent says the Trump administration “will invoke alternative legal authorities to replace the IEEPA tariffs.”
> “Treasury’s estimates show that the use of Section 122 authority, combined with potentially enhanced Section 232 and Section 301 tariffs will result in virtually unchanged tariff revenue in 2026,” he says.
> Trump wraps up news briefing after more than 40 minutes
> The president wrapped on a positive note, saying that with the ruling, “great certainty has been brought back to the economy of the United States and actually the economy of the world.”
> He repeated one of his favorite lines, saying that the U.S. is “the hottest country in the world,” and added: “We’re going to keep it that way.”
> Trump ‘couldn’t care less’ if justices who opposed his tariffs attend State of the Union address
> Trump said the justices who voted in the majority against his tariffs are still “barely” invited to Tuesday’s State of the Union address.
> But he added that “honestly I couldn’t care less if they come, OK?”
> The president gives the State of the Union before a joint session of Congress.
> But the chief executive doesn’t issue invitations to the speech, aside from his own special guests.
> The House speaker actually invites the president to give the address in the first place, and while there is always reserved seating for members of the court, Chief Justice John Roberts has previously said it’s up to individual justices if they want to attend.
> Trump: Gorsuch, Barrett’s families should be embarrassed
> The president is clearly fuming at two of the justices he nominated in his first term who sided against his tariff policy.
> “I think it’s an embarrassment to their families, if you want to know the truth. The two of them,” Trump said of Gorsuch and Barrett.
> He said, “their decision was terrible.”
> Still, he declined to say whether he regretted nominating them.
> Trump says his reading prowess is above reproach
> “I read very well. Great comprehension,” Trump said.
> The president said that, when it came to the tariffs case, “I read everything there is to read. And I said, ‘Can’t lose this case.’”
> But the Supreme Court did in fact rule against Trump’s sweeping tariff policy — an outcome Trump suggested was only possible because “judges want to be political, they want to be politically correct.”
> Italian winemakers remain skeptical despite Supreme Court ruling
> Italian winemakers greeted the decision with skepticism, warning that the ruling “may ultimately deepen uncertainty rather than deliver immediate relief to transatlantic trade.”
> The U.S. is Italy’s largest wine market, with sales having tripled in value over the past 20 years. In 2024, shipments to the U.S. reached a value of €1.93 billion, accounting for 24% of Italy’s total global wine exports, according to Unione italiana vini, or UIV, which represents more than 800 winemakers.
> New tariffs on the EU, which the Trump administration initially threatened would be 200%, had sent fear throughout the industry, which remained even after the U.S. reduced, delayed and negotiated down.
> “Paradoxically, the wine industry cannot welcome the Court’s decision as a clear victory,” said Lamberto Frescobaldi, president of the UIV trade association.
> “There is a more than likely risk that tariffs will be reimposed through alternative legal channels, compounded by the uncertainty this ruling may generate in commercial relations between Europe and the United States.”
> Trump is offering mixed messages about the importance of the tariffs the court struck down
> For months, the president has warned that if these tariffs were struck down, it would be a “disaster” for the country and it “would literally destroy the United States of America.”
> But as he faced questions about the ruling, Trump repeatedly projected a sunny future for the U.S. and dismissed the idea that the country would face ruin.
> He said the ruling gave “certainty” and said “I think you’re going to see the country get much stronger because of it.”
> Trump also said the alternative paths he will pursue to try to impose tariffs, while a much more drawn out process, will “get us more money. And I think it’s going to be great.”
> Trump dismisses Congress’ role in tariffs
> Despite the rebuke from the Supreme Court, the president is scoffing at the need to get Congress involved in enacting tariff policy.
> “I don’t have to,” Trump said when asked why wouldn’t he just work with lawmakers on tariffs. “I have the right to do tariffs, and I’ve always had the right to do tariffs.”
> The majority ruled that Congress has the power to write tax policy, which includes tariffs.
> Senate Majority Leader John Thune calls on White House to work with Congress on tariff policies
> “Tariffs can be an important and effective tool to address unfair trade practices and help level the playing field with foreign competitors,” the Senate Republican leader wrote on social media.
> The South Dakota Republican added: “Senate Republicans will continue working with the administration and our colleagues in the House to advance our shared goal to strengthen rural America, including South Dakota’s farm and ranch communities, and the broader U.S. economy.”
> Trump to impose new tariff, but it’s temporary
> On the heels of his Supreme Court defeat, the president says he’ll sign an executive order that would impose a 10% global tariff under federal law known as Section 122.
> The catch is that those tariffs would be limited to just 150 days, unless they are extended legislatively.
> The president also said he is exploring other tariffs through other avenues, such as Section 232, which would require an investigation through the Commerce Department.
> Trump says he has ‘great alternatives’ to tariffs the high court opposed
> Trump says “other alternatives will now be used to replace” his sweeping tariffs that the Supreme Court rejected.
> “We have alternatives. Great alternatives,” Trump said.
> He said the ruling opened the door to allow him to go in “probably a direction that I should have gone in the first time.”
> Trump also suggested the ruling may not “substantially constrain” tariffs going forward and mentioned using the Trade Expansion Act and other past laws, including the Tariff Act of 1930 going forward.
> He said those alternatives would simple mean a “little bit longer” process.
> Trump also scoffed at his ability to order full economic embargoes against countries, but not raise tariffs.
> “How ridiculous is that?” he asked.
> Trump calls GOP-appointed justices who supported tariff ruling ‘fools and lapdogs’
> By name Trump thanked Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh “for their strength and wisdom and love of our country” in dissenting from the majority to uphold his tariff policies.
> And of the more liberal justices who opposed him, Trump said “you can’t knock their loyalty,” even though he disagrees with their views.
> But of more conservatives justices who voted to knock down his tariffs — Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Neil Gorsuch — Trump said, “they’re just being fools and lapdogs for the RINOs and radical left Democrats.”
> Without naming them, Trump referred to the jurists by their action as “very unpatriotic and disloyal to our Constitution.”
> Trump says he will rely on other laws to continue his tariffs
> The president cited other sections of federal law that give him clearer power to impose tariffs, though those methods involve a more complex and bureaucratic process to impose the taxes on imports instead of the way Trump was quickly firing them off.
> “Their decision is incorrect. But it doesn’t matter because we have very powerful alternatives,” Trump said.
> He called it, “a little bit longer process,” and said his first attempt to impose tariffs was to try to “make things simple. But they didn’t let us do that.
> Which of Trump’s tariffs are being struck down by the Supreme Court?
> Friday’s decision upends a core set of tariffs that Trump imposed using the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA. That includes the “Liberation Day” tariffs the president slapped on nearly every country in the world last spring — as well as other IEEPA-based levies he imposed on Canada, Mexico and China. Trump also cited IEEPA to impose additional tariffs on Brazil over the trial of former President Jair Bolsonaro, and on India over its purchases of Russian oil.
> Despite Friday’s ruling, other sweeping levies remain in place. Trump used another law — Section 232 of the 1962 Trade Expansion Act — to slap sectoral tariffs on steel and aluminum, cars, copper, lumber and products like kitchen cabinets worldwide. And the president has plenty of other options to keep taxing imports aggressively.
> Republican senators praise Supreme Court decision against Trump’s tariff policies, call for Congress to reassert role
> “As a matter of policy, the empty merits of sweeping trade wars with America’s friends were evident long before today’s decision,” Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said in a statement. “But as a matter of Constitutional authority, there is now no room for doubt: the use of IEEPA to circumvent Congress in the imposition of tariffs — already without precedent — is also illegal.”
> “If the executive would like to enact trade policies that impact American producers and consumers, its path forward is crystal clear: convince their representatives under Article 1,” said the former Republican Senate leader.
> Other senators also chimed in approvingly after the court’s decision.
> “Today’s Supreme Court ruling reaffirms that only Congress has the constitutional authority to impose tariffs, and the President can only do so under a clear and limited delegation of authority from Congress,” Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine wrote on social media.
> Republican Sen. John Curtis of Utah declared “that the Founders’ system of checks and balances remains strong nearly 250 years later.” But Curtis noted that the tariff saga may not be over.
> “Several questions remain unanswered, including what happens to the revenue already collected and how the administration may use alternative authorities to impose tariffs,” said Curtis.
> National trade advocacy group applauds the ruling and urges the administration to refund tariff revenues
> The National Foreign Trade Council applauded the court ruling and urged the Trump administration to refund tariff revenue and change its approach.
> “It’s a relief to see the Supreme Court unequivocally decide that IEEPA did not provide the authority for the administration to impose more than $133 billion in tariffs on American businesses and consumers,” said Jake Colvin, president of the council. “We hope the administration will seize this opportunity to recalibrate its approach rather than rushing to replicate some or all of the tariffs through other means.”
> The council urged the administration to “identify a low-burden and automated administrative process to return tariff revenue to U.S. importers quickly and efficiently.”
> Trump calls ruling ‘deeply disappointing’
> Trump told a news conference he’s “absolutely ashamed” of justices who voted to strike down his tariffs, calling the decision “deeply disappointing.”
> It’s the first major piece of Trump’s broad agenda to come squarely before the nation’s highest court, which he helped shape with the appointments of three conservative jurists in his first term.
> Trump called the majority decision “a disgrace” when he was notified during his morning meeting with several governors, according to someone with direct knowledge of the president’s reaction who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private conversation.
> Trump was meeting privately with nearly two dozen governors from both parties when the decision was released. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
> Speaker Johnson says Congress and Trump to find path forward on tariffs in ‘coming weeks’
> House Speaker Mike Johnson backed Trump’s use of tariffs in a post on social media after the Supreme Court ruling, saying they had “brought in billions of dollars and created immense leverage for America’s trade strategy.”
> In the Supreme Court ruling, the majority found that it’s unconstitutional for the president to unilaterally set and change tariffs because taxation power clearly belongs to Congress.
> “Congress and the Administration will determine the best path forward in the coming weeks,” Johnson wrote on X.
> Some GOP welcome the decision, but may back Trump on future tariffs
> A GOP Congressman who voted for to impeach Trump says the Supreme Court decision rightly takes back power from the executive branch on tariffs.
> Washington Republican Rep. Dan Newhouse said in a statement that the ruling “restores balance between the legislative and executive branches,” adding that he’s committed to working with Trump on targeted tariffs “to secure trade deals that put American farmers, businesses, and consumers first.”
> Washington state is home to the headquarters of Costco, one of the companies most critical of the tariffs.
> Newhouse is one of the two GOP representatives to vote to impeach President Trump during his first term and be reelected. Earlier this year, he welcomed the Trump administration’s move to effectively lower wages for immigrant farmworkers.
> Newhouse announced that he is not seeking reelection.
