### 1. [Get ready for double whammy of US jobs and inflation](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2026/02/08/business/get-ready-for-double-whammy-of-us-jobs-and-inflation/)
**Source**: The Boston Globe | **Date**: 2026-02-08T06:37:00+00:00

> (Bloomberg) -- Investors and policymakers are gearing up for a busy week of US economic reports that includes arguably the two most consequential data snapshots — employment and inflation.
> The January jobs report on Wednesday and the consumer price index, due Friday, are unusually close together on the calendar after the partial government shutdown delayed each by a few days. Normally, the jobs report lands on a Friday and CPI comes the following week.
> The employment report will be even more substantive than usual. In addition to the monthly payrolls and unemployment numbers, each January release includes an annual revision to the jobs count. The so-called benchmark update is expected to reveal a notable markdown to payrolls growth in the year through March 2025.
> As for the regular monthly figures, economists predict payrolls rose 69,000 in January. Such an outcome would be the best in four months and offer some reassurance against further softening in the labor market. The unemployment rate is seen holding at 4.4%, near a four-year high.
> In the CPI data, economists will look for more evidence that inflation is on a downward trend after previous reports were complicated by last year’s record-long government shutdown. Forecasters expect an underlying metric of inflation — which excludes food and energy costs — to rise at the slowest annual pace since early 2021.
> The Federal Reserve chose to hold interest rates steady in January given signs of stabilization in the labor market and inflation that’s still elevated. Fed Governors Christopher Waller and Stephen Miran, who both dissented in favor of another rate cut, will speak in the coming week.
> “For payrolls, we estimate the BLS benchmark revision will lower the level for March 2025 by about 650K jobs — somewhat less pessimistic than the consensus. January’s jobs print may surprise on the low side, as the BLS’s modifies its ‘birth and death’ model to account for recent hiring weakness.”

> Government figures on Tuesday are projected to show another month of solid retail sales in December. Despite elevated anxiety about the high cost of living and the shaky job market, household spending has been resilient — a trend that many economists expect to endure in the near term as annual tax refunds roll out.
> While household spending growth has been solid, the housing market remains bogged down by affordability constraints. National Association of Realtors data due on Thursday will probably show sales of previously owned homes declined in January.
> Looking north, the Bank of Canada’s summary of deliberations will offer insight into its decision to hold rates steady for a second consecutive meeting, while warning that heightened uncertainty made its next move hard to predict. Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Rogers will speak on Thursday about how artificial intelligence is impacting the economy.
> Elsewhere, Japan’s election, inflation data from China to Switzerland to Brazil, gross domestic product in the UK, and rate decisions from Russia to Peru may focus investors.
> Click here for what happened in the past week, and below is our wrap of what’s coming up in the global economy.
> China sets the tone early with January credit data, including new yuan loans, aggregate financing, and money supply figures.
> Investors want to see whether easier policy is translating into stronger economic momentum. Inflation readings later in the week, including producer and consumer prices due Wednesday, should help clarify whether deflationary pressures are easing or becoming more entrenched.
> Fresh off a national election, Japan gets a big batch of data on Monday, with cash earnings and real wage data for December expected to shed light on whether income growth is fueling prices. Balance-of-payments figures are released the same day, while machinery orders later in the week will offer an update on capital spending momentum.
> In Australia, attention turns to domestic demand indicators arriving Tuesday, including household spending for December and consumer confidence readings. The figures land a week after the Reserve Bank’s hawkish pivot.
> South Korea has January unemployment data on Wednesday.
> In Southeast Asia, the spotlight turns to growth. Malaysia releases fourth-quarter GDP on Friday, alongside current-account figures, offering insight into domestic demand.
> India publishes January inflation on Thursday, a key test for the Reserve Bank of India as it weighs the scope for easing later this year. Food prices remain a swing factor, and any upside surprise could complicate the policy outlook.
> In sum, the week’s data will help determine whether Asia’s cooling inflation narrative is intact — or whether, as Australia’s experience shows, central banks risk being pushed into a more stop-start policy path as growth and prices diverge across the region.
> Following the Bank of England’s close vote against a rate cut — and Governor Andrew Bailey’s apparent endorsement of bets on a 50% chance of a March move — data in the coming week will reveal the strength of the economy in the fourth quarter. Most analysts predict only a slight acceleration to growth of 0.2% from the prior three months.
> Officials scheduled to speak include key voters including Bailey himself on Sunday and Catherine Mann on Monday. Chief economist Huw Pill is on the diary for Friday.
> In the euro zone, following the European Central Bank’s decision to keep borrowing costs unchanged, an appearance on Monday in the European Parliament by President Christine Lagarde is among several by policymakers in the coming days. Data on trade and a second reading of GDP are due on Friday.
> On Thursday, European Union leaders will gather for a meeting focused on improving the bloc’s single market — for which the ECB has provided a checklist of desired measures.
> Switzerland’s inflation number on Friday may draw attention, with a result of just 0.1% — at the lower end of the Swiss National Bank’s target range — predicted by economists. Some even forecast a return to zero price growth, while the central bank chief, Martin Schlegel, has acknowledged that more negative readings are possible this year.
> Both Norway and Denmark will release inflation numbers on Tuesday following Norway’s GDP reading the previous day.
> The diary features a number of central bank decisions around Africa:
> Eastern Europe will also see some decisions:
> Mexico-watchers on Monday get both mid- and full-month consumer price reports as a follow-up to the central bank’s decision to pause at 7%.
> Inflation picked up in early January, which to some analysts may push Banxico to the sidelines until the second quarter, when pressures related to newly enacted tariffs and excise tax hikes, along with a minimum wage increase, subside. Analysts in Citi’s latest Mexico Expectations Survey see annual prints creeping higher in January and February.
> Brazil will also post its January inflation report, which is likely to show some uptick after ending 2025 within the central bank’s target range. Consumer price increases overshot the top of the target range in three of the previous four years.
> Banco Central do Brasil stands poised to finally begin whittling away at its 15% key rate next month, but how fast and how far remain open questions.
> Argentina’s inflation ended 2025 moving in the wrong direction, with the annual reading posting slight increases in November and December while the monthly rate rose for four straight months.
> Economy Minister Luis Caputo sees January’s monthly result likely coming in near December’s 2.8%, which implies a year-on-year figure of 32.2%.
> Analysts in the central bank’s most recent survey marked up their 2026 inflation forecast to 22.4% from 20.1% previously.
> Peru’s central bank board meets Thursday, with the country’s economy in no need of stimulus and inflation running below the 2% midpoint of its 1% to 3% target range. A fifth straight hold at 4.25% looks nearly certain there.

### 5. [Gold likely to hold ground as traders track US inflation data; silver braces for volatility: Analysts](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/markets/gold/gold-likely-to-hold-ground-as-traders-track-us-inflation-data-silver-braces-for-volatility-analysts/article70607446.ece)
**Source**: The Hindu BusinessLine | **Date**: 2026-02-08T12:50:00+00:00

> In the international market, gold gained $234.7, or nearly 5 per cent, over the past week on the Comex, recovering to $5,000 per ounce from a low of $4,400 per ounce.
> Gold prices are likely to trade firm next week as traders await key economic data, including US inflation numbers, for fresh cues on interest rate outlook, while silver may remain volatile amid shifting risk sentiment and speculative activity, analysts said.
> Traders will look for cues from US GDP, PMI, non-farm payroll and inflation data. Also, inflation readings from China, Germany, and India will also be keenly watched. Speeches from US Federal Reserve officials will be closely tracked as well for indications on the timing of potential rate cuts and their impact on bullion prices, they added.
> "Gold consolidation and recovery suggest that bias still remains positive. However, in case of silver, we remain cautious of volatility and further corrections," Pranav Mer, Vice President, EBG - Commodity & Currency Research, JM Financial Services, said.
> During the past week, gold futures climbed ₹7,698, or 5.2 per cent, while silver slumped ₹15,760 or nearly 6 per cent on the Multi Commodity Exchange. The commodities market remained open on Sunday due to the presentation of the Union Budget by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.
> "Gold and silver endured an extremely volatile week as a sharp dollar rebound, shifting Fed expectations and aggressive position unwinding triggered one of the steepest corrections in decades," Manav Modi, Analyst - Commodities, Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd (MOFSL), said.
> He said easing tensions between Washington and Tehran, progress in tariff negotiations by President Donald Trump and reduced risk of a US government shutdown lowered safe-haven premiums, while Kevin Warsh being nominated as the next Fed Chair also prompted traders to scale back aggresive rate-cut expectations.
> "The unwind was severe: gold recorded its sharpest decline in nearly four decades, while silver languished, amplified by heavy call option positioning, margin calls and speculative driven liquidation," Modi noted.
> The domestic markets were not spared from the turmoil. Though the Union Budget largely met expectations with no major-specific surprises, volatility in bullion persisted amid swings in the rupee. A softer USD/ INR following progress on a potential trade deal between New Delhi and Washington, which pressurised local bullion prices.
> Despite the steep selloff, Modi explained that signs of stabilisation emerged as forced liquidation eased and value buying returned across both metals.
> "A sharp rebound followed, aided by weaker economic data and value buying after a near 15 per cent correction in gold," he said adding that domestic gains were further supported by rebound in USD/ INR from recent lows.
> In the international market, gold gained $234.7, or nearly 5 per cent, over the past week on the Comex, recovering to $5,000 per ounce from a low of $4,400 per ounce.
> "There has not been much change in the fundamentals, as geopolitical uncertainty still prevails. Central banks and ETFs investors continue to add gold to their holdings, while crypto firms have also increased buying to create & trade gold tokens, backed by physical assets," Mer said.
> However, silver futures remained under pressure, slipping $1.63, or 2.08 per cent.
> "Volatility grips silver as prices pass through a phase of high swings after the parabolic rally that ended on January 30 with a flash crash from an all-time high around $121 to a recent low of $64 per ounce," Pranav Mer of JM Financial Services said.
> According to Manav Modi, physical demand from China ahead of the Lunar New Year, has remained resilient and could help absorb further selling.
> "Broader fundamentals still support bullion through 2026, driven by central bank buying, fiscal concerns and geopolitical risks, though near-term volatility is likely to remain elevated," he said.
> Analysts said that macroeconomic data and remarks from Fed officials are poised to dominate next week's agenda, traders expect continued volatility but see opportunities for short-term buying on dips, especially in gold.

### 1. [For Better or Warsh: The Federal Reserve May Be Wall Street's Ticking Time Bomb in 2026](https://www.fool.com/investing/2026/02/07/for-better-or-warsh-fed-wall-st-ticking-time-bomb/)
**Source**: The Motley Fool | **Date**: 2026-02-07T09:16:00+00:00

> President Donald Trump's Fed Chair nominee, Kevin Warsh, could add another layer of concern to an already precarious stock market.
> For much of the last seven years, optimists have been in firm control on Wall Street. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC +0.47%) has risen by at least 16% in six of the last seven years (the 2022 bear market being the exception), while the iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI +0.04%) and growth-powered Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC +0.90%) have both rallied to several record-closing highs.
> While upside catalysts have been plentiful, including the rise of artificial intelligence, the advent of quantum computing, and the prospect of lower interest rates on the horizon, there are always headwinds threatening to pull the rug out from beneath investors. Sometimes these risks come from unlikely sources, such as our nation's foremost financial institution, the Federal Reserve.
> With Jerome Powell's term as Fed Chair set to end on May 15, President Donald Trump nominated former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh as his replacement on Jan. 30. While Warsh will still need to be confirmed by the Senate Banking Committee, followed by the Senate itself, his potential ascension to head of the central bank adds another layer of concern for the stock market.
> Fed Chair Jerome Powell's term ends on May 15, 2026. Image source: Official Federal Reserve Photo.
> To preface the following discussion, understand that every potential Fed chair nominee to replace Powell would come with question marks. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) -- the 12-person body, including the Fed chair, responsible for setting our nation's monetary policy -- doesn't always make the right move. In other words, members of the FOMC are fallible, and every Fed chair and prior nominee has had their faults on display.
> Warsh, who served on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve from Feb. 24, 2006, to March 31, 2011, has previously been criticized for his focus on taming inflation during the financial crisis rather than tackling a challenging labor market. His past desire to keep interest rates elevated has commonly earned him the label of "hawkish" (i.e., someone who favors tightening monetary policy to combat inflation).
> But it's not Warsh's potential take on interest rates that risks stirring the pot at the nation's central bank. Instead, it's his opinion that the Fed shouldn't be an active market participant and is better suited to be on the sidelines. In short, Trump's nominee favors deleveraging the Federal Reserve's $6.6 trillion balance sheet, which is primarily comprised of U.S. Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities.
> Putting aside whether deleveraging is the right or wrong move, selling Treasuries could create challenges for the U.S. economy. Since bond prices and yields are inversely related, the nation's central bank dumping Treasury bonds and depressing their price would increase interest rates at the long end of the yield curve. In turn, this can drive up borrowing costs, including mortgages.
> Although Warsh's desire to deleverage the Fed's balance sheet would likely drag down the prevailing inflation rate, it could adversely affect housing affordability and drive up lending costs elsewhere.
> However, the question marks that come with a new Fed chair nominee represent just one piece of a potentially dangerous puzzle for Wall Street and investors.
> Traditionally, the Fed has been viewed as a stabilizing, if not outright boring, force on Wall Street. Though the FOMC is often behind the curve with its interest rate decisions -- this stems from economists basing their decisions on backward-looking economic data -- investors take solace in the 12-member body having a unified approach.
> But what we've witnessed since the summer of 2025 is nothing short of historic division at the central bank. Each of the last five FOMC meetings has featured dissents from the agreed-upon decision.
> Furthermore, two of these meetings (October and December) had dissents in opposite directions. While the consensus FOMC decision was a 25-basis-point reduction of the federal funds target rate in October and December, both meetings featured at least one member who favored no rate cut and another who supported a 50-basis-point reduction. There have only been three FOMC meetings in the last 36 years with opposite dissents, and two have occurred over the previous 3.5 months.
> Anna is correct below when she says:"I have not seen a meeting with so much contradictions."---This meeting was a mess.See the labels in the dot plot below.One member of the FOMC thinks the Fed is going to HIKE rates this year. One (Stephen Miran) thinks it is going to cut... https://t.co/TRUQmD5I2E pic.twitter.com/qPlJGL57ln
> Kevin Warsh, assuming he clears the necessary vote hurdles in the Senate Banking Committee and then the Senate, is unlikely to bridge this historic division. It can be argued that investors are more likely to forgive a wrong or tardy move by the FOMC than to tolerate a lack of cohesion regarding our nation's monetary policy.
> This division comes at a particularly precarious time for the stock market. The S&P 500's Shiller Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio entered 2026 at its second-priciest valuation in 155 years. Previous instances in which the Shiller P/E Ratio has surpassed 30 have eventually resulted in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and/or Nasdaq Composite shedding between 20% and 89% of their respective value.
> There's little margin for error on Wall Street. A historically divided FOMC, coupled with central bank balance sheet deleveraging concerns, may turn the Fed into the stock market's ticking time bomb in 2026.

### 2. [Federal Reserve governor Miran steps down from White House post](https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/federal-reserve-governor-miran-steps-white-house-post-129833737)
**Source**: ABC News | **Date**: 2026-02-04T08:36:00+00:00

> Federal Reserve governor Stephen Miran has stepped down from his position as chair of the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers, ending a controversial arrangement where he held positions at both institutions
> WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve governor Stephen Miran has stepped down from his position as chair of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, ending a controversial arrangement where he held positions at both institutions.
> His resignation was confirmed by White House spokesman Kush Desai late Tuesday.
> President Donald Trump appointed Miran in September to a seat on the Fed's seven-member board of governors after Adriana Kugler, who was appointed by President Joe Biden, abruptly resigned. Miran completed her term, which ended Jan. 31. Yet he can remain on the Fed's board until a replacement is confirmed by the Senate.
> It is unusual for someone to keep a White House position while also serving as a Fed governor, a nonpartisan position. Previous presidents have appointed aides to the Fed, but for decades they gave up their White House positions before joining the Fed. Miran took an unpaid leave of absence instead.
> Miran said when he was named in September that he would step down from his position at the CEA if he remained on the Fed board after Jan. 31. Fed governors vote on interest rate decisions and bank regulatory policy.
> “In accordance with the pledge he made to the Senate during his confirmation to the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors, Stephen Miran has submitted his resignation from the Council of Economic Advisers," Desai said.
> The move underscores the intrigue around the Fed and its upcoming personnel changes. Trump has nominated Kevin Warsh, a former Fed official, to replace current Fed chair Jerome Powell, whose term atop the central bank ends May 15.
> Yet Powell could, under a quirk in the Fed's structure, remain on the board after his term as chair ends and deny Trump the opportunity to fill another seat. Many observers, as result, expect Warsh to take Miran's seat and then be elevated to replace Powell in May, but that sequence of events hasn't yet been confirmed.

**Source**: USA TODAY | **Date**: 2026-02-09T08:46:00+00:00

> At pivotal moments in American economic history, the Federal Reserve needs more than a credentialed academic or a cautious caretaker. It needs a steady hand with real world experience, institutional memory, and the confidence to act decisively when the stakes are high. President Donald Trump’s nomination of Kevin Warsh to serve as the next Chair of the Federal Reserve is exactly that kind of choice.

### 4. [Kevin Warsh's Past Policy Positions Have Commercial Real Estate Guessing](https://commercialobserver.com/2026/02/kevin-warsh-policy-positions/)
**Source**: Commercial Observer | **Date**: 2026-02-09T12:40:00+00:00

> © 2026 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy
> As the commercial real estate industry adapts to a likely future of Kevin Warsh leading the Federal Reserve, the former Fed governor’s past record provides only mixed signals on how his monetary policy may dictate transaction activity.
> President Donald Trump nominated Warsh for the Fed chairmanship at the end of January. The parsing of Warsh’s public record for clues on how he might lead began immediately. (He still needs Senate approval before his term can begin in mid-May.)
> Warsh pressed for the central bank to lower interest rates in a July 2025 interview on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” Yet, he also took a hawkish stance during his five years as a Fed governor from 2006 to 2011, resisting rate cuts despite facing an economic downturn.
> Warsh also morphed into a vocal critic of the Fed’s bond-buying program, leading to his resignation from the central bank. But this was only after initially supporting quantitative easing (QE) efforts to jump-start the economy in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. The former Goldman Sachs investment banker has said in past speeches that the Fed’s balance sheet purchases should be reduced, criticizing previous usage of QE as too aggressive and leading to “artificially depressed” borrowing rates.
> Sam Chandan, director of the Chao-Hon Chen Institute for Global Real Estate Finance at New York University, said Warsh’s past background with the Fed and efforts to curb inflation will aid his credibility when seeking more interest rate cuts. Chandan cautioned that Warsh’s past stances may not dictate his current views on monetary policy.
> “Circumstances were quite different when he was on the board as compared to where we are today,” Chandan said. “My suspicion is he’s sensitive to the increasingly evident weakness in the labor market.”
> Chandan noted that about one-third of the Fed’s balance sheet consists of mortgage-backed securities, and if the new chairman opts to support reversing these bond holdings it could have repercussions for the CRE space.
> “If he seeks to unwind those positions quickly, residential mortgage rates will rise, with secondary effects in multifamily markets and elsewhere,” Chandan said. “If they lean into unwinding of Treasurys, we will also see an impact in commercial real estate.”
> The selection of Warsh as Fed chair comes just over eight years after he was a finalist for the job in Trump’s first term before the president opted instead for Jerome Powell. Since assuming office a second time in January 2025, Trump has waged war on Powell for keeping interest rates higher for longer to fight inflation.
> Warsh’s past experience at the central bank has helped alleviate some concerns in the CRE industry over the past year about the Fed losing its long-standing independence from political influence. Still, his July 2025 CNBC interview calling for lower interest rates while criticizing the Fed’s restrictive policies under Powell cast doubt on whether he will truly govern independently. But such views then were more in the mainstream, said Briggs Elwell, CEO and co-founder of RLTYco, which provides financial and tax services to real estate clients.
> “A lot of people had opinions then that there should have been an acceleration toward rate cuts. But, today, if you were to poll people across the board in both real estate and finance, there’s less of a pressure to decrease rates versus where it was a year ago,” Elwell said. “Inflation has stabilized and there is less of a need to put some more buying power into the system, so I would say that his opinion then is probably very different from what it is today, and my gut is he would be for a slight reduction but definitely not anything aggressive.”
> Trump announced Warsh’s nomination on social media platform Truth Social in the early morning hours of Jan. 30, two days after the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) voted 10-2 to maintain its benchmark interest rate at between 3.5 percent and 3.75 percent. The FOMC under Powell had previously cut rates a quarter point three meetings in a row to end 2025.
> The central bank established a 2 percent inflation target in 2012 measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index as part of long-term goals and policy strategy announced under then-Fed chair Ben Bernanke. PCE inflation has dropped sharply from its 7 percent peak in June 2022 (the highest level at time since 1981) but remained well above the Fed’s 2 percent goal. The latest data in November showed a 2.8 percent annual increase.
> Brian Bailey, a former senior policy adviser on CRE matters for the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta who joined CRE loan servicer Trimont as a researcher last year, said Warsh will likely examine whether the Fed’s inflation gauge should be adjusted.
> “I think conversation on that front is healthy,” Bailey said. “It is a critical question not only for the commercial real estate industry, but for the rank-and-file consumers.”
> Reshaping the FOMC to bring down interest rates has been a chief focus of Trump over the past year. That included his ongoing attempt to fire Fed governor Lisa Cook over alleged mortgage fraud. The U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments on Jan. 19 over whether Trump had the power to remove Cook, and indicated her job was likely safe. She was appointed by then-President Joe Biden to a 14-year Fed term that expires in 2038.
> The 47th president also targeted Powell as part of a U.S. Justice Department subpoena in early January tied to costly renovations at the Fed’s Washington, D.C., offices. North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican who is the senior member of the Senate Banking Committee, said the day of Trump’s pick of Warsh he will oppose the nomination until the probe into Powell is “fully” resolved.
> Warsh is still expected to gain U.S. Senate approval despite Tillis’s objections, according to David McCarthy, managing director, chief lobbyist and head of legislative affairs at the Commercial Real Estate Finance Council (CREFC). McCarthy noted that Tillis’s opposition is “rooted in procedure rather than substance” and that Republicans across Capitol Hill praising Warsh’s nomination bodes well for his getting confirmed.
> “I certainly expect his past actions as a Fed governor and prolific commentator to be well reviewed and subject to scrutiny,” McCarthy said. “But, currently, the cloud over Fed independence is the biggest obstacle to his confirmation. If that clears, I would expect him to be confirmed in short order.”
> Prior to his five-year run with the Fed, Warsh was an executive secretary of the National Economic Council from 2002 to 2006 under then-President George W. Bush. He more recently has been a fellow at the conservative-leaning Hoover Institution at Stanford University.
> Lisa Pendergast, president and CEO of CREFC, said Warsh was viewed by the organization as “accretive and thoughtful” when addressing the 2008 financial crisis as a central bank governor under Bernanke. She added that his time with the National Economic Council will help position him to respond to today’s economic climate, while his Wall Street experience may generate a “pragmatic view” for the correlation between credit conditions and the CRE market.
> Pendergast stressed that the foundation of the Fed should help maintain its long-standing independence given that FOMC decisions are collectively decided through its seven governors and five regional bank presidents. She said Fed independence will be a main focus of the Senate confirmation process along with Warsh’s views on its balance sheet and bank supervision.
> Another key CRE issue Warsh will play a role in if approved as chair will be the Fed’s forthcoming Basel III capital proposal. A previous Basel proposal outlined in July 2023 faced some pushback in the CRE industry since it would have required the biggest banks to increase their capital requirements by around 9 percent on average.
> “This revised proposal will be a key policy for CRE, and we remain optimistic that the revised framework will not constrain the flow of capital and credit to real estate,” Pendergast said. “As we noted in our comment letter on the original proposal, we were concerned with the overall capital charges to banks and specific provisions that could have disfavored securitization and warehouse lending, among others.”
> Since the Warsh announcement, long-term interest rates dictated by the 10-Year Treasury yield have risen slightly and were at 4.25 percent at the close of trading Feb. 4.
> The upward movement of 10-Year Treasurys reflects the reality that longer-term borrowing costs are influenced by myriad other factors such as government debt and inflation trends, with bond investors not banking yet on a “massive series of rate drops,” according to RLTYco’s Elwell. Even if the benchmark interest rate is cut later this year by Warsh and the other governors, the 10-Year will likely remain relatively unchanged and bring “stability” for the CRE market, Elwell said,
> Even if long-term rates remain elevated, a reduction in short-term borrowing costs could throw some more life into the construction lending space, according to Patrick Southern, an agent for brokerage firm Serhant, who has helped facilitate deals for a number of new multifamily and condo projects sprouting up in Jersey City, N.J.
> “So many of these deals are syndicated deals, which means there’s a lot of fees, with [limited partners] and [general partners] and bank fees, so, when they get underwritten, construction finance is a real line item and affects the viability of a lot of these deals to be able to pencil,” Southern said. “Any little relief helps to try to get some more housing out of the ground because we have an affordability issue in many marketplaces, and a good fix for that is more housing, and it’s just really expensive to build.”
> Lower interest rates under Warsh would also be positive for investment sales and leasing activity, according to Adam Henick, co-founder of Current Real Estate Advisors, but he cautioned that the long end of the curve could hinge on whether Warsh ends up shrinking the Fed’s $6.6 billion balance sheet.
> Henick said Warsh’s evolving positions on interest rates and qualitative easing is a positive sign that he is willing to keep an open mind on monetary policy based on whatever economic conditions arise.
> “If you’re not open-minded to a variety of different policies or solutions, then you run the risk of having bad policies because you only lean hawkish or dovish,” Henick said. “If things actually are data dependent and there is a re-evaluation of the economy on an ongoing regular basis, then that should lead someone like the incoming Fed chairman to reassess his position from time to time based on the merits of the case.”
> Powell’s term as Fed chair is slated to expire on May 15, which leaves him two more  FOMC meetings in mid-March and late April. He is eligible to remain a Fed governor until January 2028, but has not indicated yet whether he will remain with the FOMC.
> A Fed chair has not stayed on as a governor for an extended period after their term ended since Marriner Eccles, who served on the board for three years after he was replaced by President Harry Truman in 1948. While Powell would only have one vote, Trimont’s Bailey said the soon-to-be former chairman staying on with the FOMC a little longer could prove beneficial as the board gets set to transition to new leadership under Warsh.
> “With all of the connections and all of the engagement with both the domestic as well as the foreign finance and economic community, he would be a phenomenal ambassador to assist Chair-designate Warsh in the completion of his duties,” Bailey said.

### 5. [The Federal Reserve Meeting Starts Today—Here's What You Need to Know](https://www.investopedia.com/the-fed-will-decide-whether-to-cut-rates-11893530)
**Source**: Investopedia | **Date**: 2026-01-27T22:11:00+00:00

> The Federal Reserve will likely pause its interest rate cuts on Wednesday, but analysts are watching for any hints that it will resume later this year.
> The Fed, which kicked off its two-day meeting on Tuesday, lowered interest rates three times in late 2025 to boost a weakening job market. Now, however, the labor market seems to be stabilizing, and strong consumer spending continues to fuel economic growth.
> Markets are forecasting a delay in any potential 2026 cuts—and will look to Fed Chair Jerome Powell for validation of those views. Powell will hold a press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET on Wednesday,  when reporters are sure to ask him about President Donald Trump’s attacks on the Fed.
> Powell isn’t expected to say much new on that front. But analysts also don’t expect him to say much on the Fed’s rate plans for the year either. He might offer a slight indication that the Fed may cut rates again, but provide little guidance on when.
> The Federal Reserve's fed funds rate influences a wide range of interest rates, including those on credit cards and certificates of deposit.
> “While Powell is likely to sound noncommittal around near-term rate cuts, we expect him to remind market participants that the median Fed official still looks for easing this year,” wrote Oscar Munoz, chief U.S. macro strategist at TD Securities. “The path of least resistance continues to be further rate cuts.”
> The Fed last year lowered its benchmark federal funds rate to between 3.5% to 3.75%, continuing to bring borrowing costs down after the inflation spike in 2021 and 2022 forced the Fed to sharply raise rates.
> It wasn’t unanimous in doing so. The Fed’s 19-member committee was unusually split in 2025, with dissents from hawks arguing against rate cuts and from doves seeking more aggressive action.
> Recent economic data have “tilted a bit more toward the hawks,” wrote Scott Anderson, BMO’s chief U.S. economist, which bolsters the case for Wednesday’s pause in rate cuts. Employment growth remained sluggish in December with some 50,000 jobs added, but the unemployment rate slipped to 4.4%.
> Last year’s government shutdown ended up having “no visible impact on real consumer spending growth,” Anderson wrote. Retail sales rose sharply before the holidays, which has economists hiking their GDP projections.
> “Expect Powell to emphasize that policy remains in a ‘good place’ right now, with little urgency to act in either direction,” Anderson wrote.
> Investors have reacted to the sunnier prospects by delaying their expectations for the Fed’s next cut.
> A March rate cut seemed like a coin flip a month ago, but traders now see only a 16% chance of that, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch tool, which uses futures markets pricing to determine probabilities. Some economists now anticipate the Fed may not cut rates at all in 2026—or at least wait until the second half of the year.
> “There is no hurry to act,” Bank of America economist Aditya Bhave wrote.
> Even so, the shift to more hawkish market pricing “creates risks of a dovish surprise,” Bhave wrote, if Powell’s remarks lead investors to swing back to betting on more cuts.
> Bhave flagged a key question for Powell’s press conference: how will he frame December’s lower unemployment rate and its impacts on Fed policy?
> “Markets will be sensitive to the extent to which Powell leans into the decline … or downplays it as just a single month's worth of data,” Bhave wrote.
> January’s jobs report, which is due out on Feb. 6, will provide more clarity on whether markets’ more hawkish expectations for the Fed will prove right.
> “It would take only one bad labor market report to prompt a swift reappraisal,” wrote Samuel Tombs, chief U.S. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. “Still, we concede that the path to a March easing has narrowed.”
> All the economic questions, however, may be overshadowed by President Donald Trump’s attempts to reshape the central bank.
> “Powell's press conference might be dominated by questions about politics rather than policy,” BofA’s Bhave wrote.
> Trump has repeatedly slammed the Fed for not cutting interest rates more quickly, arguing that high borrowing costs hold back the economy.
> The tensions reached a new high this month, with Powell pushing back on Department of Justice subpoenas relating to the Fed’s headquarters renovations. In a video response, Powell said he kept lawmakers informed about the HQ costs and that they were “pretexts” for Trump to intimidate the Fed into slashing rates.
> Trump has also sought to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook, citing still-unresolved allegations of mortgage fraud, which would open up a seat at the Fed for Trump to fill. At a hearing last week, Supreme Court officials were skeptical that he could fire Cook and raised concerns that the Fed might lose its independence to make policy decisions. Powell attended the Supreme Court hearing.
> Having weighed in already, it’s not clear whether Powell will say more on the topic on Wednesday.
> He may also stay mum on whether he’d remain on the Fed board past May. His four-year term as Fed chair expires then, but he’d still be able to vote as a regular board member until 2028.
> Powell's recent pushback against Trump's attacks could make him more likely to remain on the Fed board after his leadership role expires, according to Larry Meyer, a former Fed governor and co-founder of Monetary Policy Analytics. That would give Trump one fewer opening on the Fed for now.
> Still, Meyer added, Powell "does not owe an answer on this just yet."
> Federal Reserve. "Open Markets Operations."

### 1. [In the Arctic, the major climate threat of black carbon is overshadowed by geopolitical tensions](https://www.orlandosentinel.com/2026/02/09/climate-arctic-black-carbon/)
**Source**: Orlando Sentinel | **Date**: 2026-02-09T17:34:00+00:00

> REYKJAVIK, Iceland (AP) — As rising global temperatures speed up the melting of sea ice in the Arctic Ocean, it’s set off a boom of ships taking routes that previously were frozen and not traversable.
> The increase in marine Arctic traffic, which received increased attention as President Donald Trump pushed for the United States to take over Greenland, has come with a heavy environmental cost: black carbon, or soot, that spews from ships and makes the ice melt even faster. Several countries are making a case for ships in the Arctic to use cleaner fuels that cause less pollution in meetings this week with international shipping regulators.
> Glaciers, snow and ice covered in the soot emitted by ships have less ability to reflect the sun. Instead, the sun’s heat is absorbed, helping to make the Arctic the fastest warming place on Earth. In turn, melting Arctic sea ice can affect weather patterns around the world.
> “It ends up in a never-ending cycle of increased warming,” said Sian Prior, lead adviser for the Clean Arctic Alliance, a coalition of nonprofits focused on the Arctic and shipping. “We need to regulate emissions and black carbon, in particular. Both are completely unregulated in the Arctic.”
> In December, France, Germany, the Solomon Islands and Denmark proposed that the International Maritime Organization require ships traveling in Arctic waters to use “polar fuels,” which are lighter and emit less carbon pollution than the widely used maritime fuels known as residuals. The proposal includes steps that companies would take to comply and the geographic area it would apply to — all ships traveling north of the 60th parallel. The proposal was expected to be presented to the IMO’s Pollution Prevention and Response Committee this week and possibly another committee in April.
> A 2024 ban on using a type of residual known as heavy fuel oil in the Arctic has had only modest impacts so far, partly because of loopholes.
> The push to reduce black carbon, which studies have shown has a warming impact 1,600 times that of carbon dioxide over a 20-year span, is happening at a time of conflicting interests, both internationally and among the countries that have coastlines in the Arctic.
> In recent months, Trump’s periodic comments about the need to “own” Greenland to bolster U.S. security have raised many issues, from Greenland’s sovereignty to the future of the NATO alliance. Pollution and other environmental issues in the Arctic have taken a backseat.
> Trump, who has called climate change a “con job,” has also pushed back against global policies aimed at fighting it. Last year, the IMO was expected to adopt new regulations that would have imposed carbon fees on shipping, which supporters said would have pushed companies to use cleaner fuels and electrify fleets where possible. Then Trump intervened, lobbying hard for nations to vote no. The measure was postponed for a year, its prospects at best uncertain. Given that, it’s hard to see the IMO making fast progress on the current proposal to limit black carbon in the Arctic.
> Even inside Arctic nations, which are most impacted by black carbon and other shipping pollution, there are internal tensions around such regulations. Iceland is a good example. While the country is a world leader in green technologies such as carbon capture and the use of thermal energies for heating, conservationists say the country has made less progress on regulating pollution in its seas. That is because the fishing industry, one of the country’s most important, holds huge sway.
> “The industry is happy with profits, unhappy with the taxes and not engaged in issues like climate or biodiversity,” said Arni Finnsson, board chair of the Iceland Nature Conservation Association.
> Finnsson added that the costs of using cleaner fuels or electrifying fleets have also prompted resistance.
> “I think the government is waking up, but they still have to wait for the (fishing) industry to say yes,” he said.
> The country has not taken a position on the pending polar fuels proposal. In a statement, Iceland’s Ministry of Environment, Energy and Climate said the proposal was “positive with regard to its purpose and basic content,” but that further study was needed. The statement added that Iceland supports stronger measures to counter shipping emissions and reduce black carbon.
> Soot pollution has increased in the Arctic as cargo ships, fishing boats and even some cruise liners are traveling more in the waters that connect the northernmost parts of Iceland, Greenland, Canada, Russia, Norway, Finland, Sweden and the United States.
> Between 2013 and 2023, the number of ships entering waters north of the 60th parallel increased by 37%, according to the Arctic Council, an intergovernmental forum made up of the eight countries with territory in the Arctic. In that same period, the total distance traversed by ships in the Arctic increased 111%.
> Black carbon emissions have also increased. In 2019, 2,696 metric tons of black carbon was emitted from ships north of the 60th parallel compared with 3,310 metric tons in 2024, according to a study by Energy and Environmental Research Associates. The study found that fishing boats were the biggest source of black carbon.
> It also found that the 2024 ban on heavy fuel oil would only result in a small reduction in black carbon. Waivers and exceptions allow some ships to continue using it until 2029.
> Environmental groups and concerned countries see regulating ship fuel as the only way to realistically reduce black carbon. That is because getting nations to agree to limit traffic would likely be impossible. The lure of fishing, resource extraction and shorter shipping distances is too great. Ships can save days on some trips between Asia and Europe by sailing through the Arctic.
> Still, the path known as the Northern Sea Route is only traversable a few months of the year, and even then ships must be accompanied by icebreakers. Those dangers, combined with Arctic pollution concerns, have driven some companies to pledge to stay away — at least for now.
> “The debate around the Arctic is intensifying, and commercial shipping is part of that discussion,” wrote Søren Toft, CEO of Mediterranean Shipping Company, the world’s largest container shipping company, in a LinkedIn post last month. “Our position at MSC is clear. We do not and will not use the Northern Sea Route.”

### 2. [Elliott Branmer Provides Insight on Tech Sector Volatility Amid Geopolitical Tensions and Rising Yields](https://www.usatoday.com/press-release/story/24510/elliott-branmer-provides-insight-on-tech-sector-volatility-amid-geopolitical-tensions-and-rising-yields/)
**Source**: USA TODAY | **Date**: 2026-01-28T23:32:00+00:00

> In the wake of a sharp contraction in global equity markets, Elliott Branmer, Senior Equity Fund Manager at Ordefoco Asset Management, has released an advisory on the current volatility within the technology sector. As the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 2.4%, Branmer emphasizes the need for investor calm, urging market participants to look beyond short-term sentiment shifts and focus on the structural reset happening in tech valuations.
> The recent market downturn has been triggered by a combination of geopolitical risks and rising US Treasury yields, which have led to a broad-based sell-off across global indices. Major semiconductor and hyperscale computing stocks saw significant retracements, influenced by concerns over US trade tariffs and the growing “AI Implementation Gap.” Branmer highlights that, while the infrastructure-level CapEx remains stable, the market is becoming increasingly concerned with the Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) for Generative AI applications.
> Branmer views the ongoing correction as a necessary “clearing event,” distinguishing companies with sustainable growth from speculative momentum stocks. With his focus on quality growth, Branmer notes that in this environment, the primary metric for stock selection has shifted from revenue growth to capital allocation efficiency.
> Branmer identifies three key drivers behind the current market volatility:
> While Branmer remains bullish on the long-term outlook for technology, he warns of risks within the supply chain, particularly due to the concentration of liquidity in a few large tech companies. He also notes that delays in the commercialization of AI technologies may test investors’ patience in the near term.
> Branmer advises investors to pivot from high-volatility, beta-driven strategies to quality growth strategies, focusing on companies with strong balance sheets and consistent earnings. As trade policies and interest rates stabilize, those technology firms with durable competitive advantages will be best positioned for long-term success.
> Ordefoco Asset Management is a leading global investment firm specializing in active management strategies across equity, fixed income, and alternative investments. With a commitment to disciplined research, rigorous risk management, and long-term value creation, Ordefoco provides customized investment solutions to institutional and private clients worldwide.

### 3. [Amid heightened geopolitical tensions, the World Governments Summit is a masterclass in soft power](https://monocle.com/affairs/world-governments-summit-soft-power/)
**Source**: Monocle | **Date**: 2026-02-03T10:26:00+00:00

> The World Governments Summit (WGS) is taking place this week at the Madinat Jumeirah in Dubai. The annual gathering has become one of the most packed fixtures on the diplomatic calendar, with attendees including presidents, prime ministers and policymakers from across the globe.
> This year’s summit opens amid heightened regional tensions: the arrival of Donald Trump’s “beautiful armada” in Middle Eastern waters highlights the president’s renewed threats to strike Iran. Meanwhile, trilateral talks involving US, Ukrainian and Russian officials are unfolding in Abu Dhabi.
> Over the coming days, leaders expected in Dubai include Guy Parmelin, president of Switzerland; Edi Rama, Albania’s outspoken prime minister; Pedro Sánchez, Spain’s premier; and Nawaf Salam, the prime minister of Lebanon. Large delegations from Africa are also in attendance, reinforcing a pattern seen at recent UAE-hosted events: a concerted effort by Abu Dhabi and Dubai to deepen political, economic and diplomatic ties with the continent.
> One of the summit’s defining features is its format. Unlike the panel-heavy structure of many international gatherings, WGS leans heavily into majlis-style meetings, where leaders sit together in intimate, circular arrangements to help foster conversation. It’s a reminder that diplomacy in this part of the world is as much about trust and proximity as it is about policy papers.
> WGS also brings together business leaders, entrepreneurs, aviation chiefs, technologists and media figures, blurring the lines between public policy and private power. This is part of the event’s appeal – and its challenge. With so many disciplines under one roof, the conversations are rich but the outcomes can feel diffuse. How much of what is discussed here will genuinely travel beyond Dubai?
> Still, WGS is a masterclass in soft power. The UAE positions itself not as the loudest voice in the room but as the host – a convener that creates space for others to talk, negotiate and test ideas. “It is a lab for governments,” says Mohammad al-Gergawi, the minister of cabinet affairs in the UAE and the WGS chairman.
> That sense of choreography extends well beyond the main stage. Much of the event’s business happens between sessions in smaller meeting rooms, in the courtyard of Madinat Jumeirah’s conference centre and over coffee. The Monocle Café has become part of that informal ecosystem – a place where ministers pause between commitments, advisers trade notes and delegates briefly step out of diplomatic mode.
> Monocle Radio will be broadcasting from the summit throughout the week, with Monocle’s head of radio, Tom Edwards; editor in chief, Andrew Tuck; and chairman and editorial director, Tyler Brûlé, joining me on the ground. If there’s one thing that WGS does well it’s creating space for good conversation. Slowing down, gathering people around the same table and letting dialogue unfold is needed now more than ever.

### 4. [Geopolitics will cast a long shadow over the 2026 Milan Cortina Winter Olympic Games](https://theconversation.com/geopolitics-will-cast-a-long-shadow-over-the-2026-milan-cortina-winter-olympic-games-273764)
**Source**: The Conversation | **Date**: 2026-01-27T20:30:00+00:00

> This winter’s Olympic games will not be a normal international sporting event. A cloud of geopolitical tension looms over the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics, as well as the upcoming FIFA Men’s World Cup.
> The tension escalated after Prime Minister Mark Carney’s speech at the World Economic Forum, where he spelled out his vision for a new world order for middle powers. It stood out starkly against United States President Donald Trump’s own speech at Davos, where he continued expressing his interest in acquiring Greenland from Denmark.
> As a result, the 2026 Winter Olympics will likely disrupt the International Olympic Committee’s stated goal of sport bringing the world together under one banner in unique ways. Rather than muting political conflict, the Games may amplify it.
> The unifying mission of the Olympics already sits uneasily alongside previous debates over the morality of hosting the Games in repressive states. For decades, critics have argued that such regimes use the Games to improve their global image and advance their political and economic goals.
> International sports events provide widespread media coverage and brand exposure. That spotlight is particularly attractive for authoritarian and repressive regimes seeking legitimacy on the world stage.
> Access to a western audience provides these states with the opportunity to “sportswash” their legitimate authority through a carefully curated image.
> Read more:
>       How repressive regimes are using international sporting events for nation-building
> Repressive regimes have increasingly pursued this strategy. Research shows that the share of international sporting events hosted by autocracies fell from 36 per cent in 1945-88 to 15 per cent in 1989-2012, but has rebounded to 37 per cent since 2012.
> Sportswashing involves the use of sport to redirect public attention away from unethical conduct. In the case of international sporting events, the aim is typically to improve the reputation of the host nation by using the immense popularity of sport to “wash” away scrutiny linked to human rights abuses or democratic backsliding.
> Sportswashing can also work to establish broader global acceptance of repressive regimes, particularly when western institutions accept their wealth and acquiesce to their goals.
> International sporting organizations also stand to gain from this arrangement as well. Authoritarian hosts are more likely to acquiesce to demands to build costly, single-use sport facilities, as they do not face the kind of democratic backlash that could arise after using public funds for an event that carries little public benefit.
> In some cases, these regimes have even been willing to bribe officials to gain the votes necessary to win bids to host these sporting events.
> There is often a symbiotic relationship between repressive regimes and international sporting organizations. However, the Milan Cortina Games are unlikely to serve up the sportswashing narratives we have seen recently. Instead, the political stories of the 2026 Winter Olympics are likely to be more explicitly nationalist.
> Sport is a powerful vehicle for national rhetoric. It can reinforce a person’s social identity or how they see themselves in relation to others by encouraging people to see themselves as a member of a team or country, and celebrating victory as a collective success or interpreting defeat as a symbolic loss.
> Sport also possesses powerful symbolism that can be exploited to great affect in forming a coherent national identity. In this way, sporting events can reinforce national identity as an objective symbol that connects to primitive forms of national ideology.
> In the lead-up to the 2026 Winter Olympics, a series of geopolitical flashpoints has intensified political tensions surrounding the Games. These include the U.S. invasion of Venezuela, Trump’s desire to annex both Greenland and Canada and his ongoing trade disputes with traditional allies.
> Whether it’s tension between the European Union and the U.S. or between Canada and the U.S., there are many story lines that can serve as galvanizing moments for nationalist rhetoric.
> The 4 Nations Face-Off, won by Canada a year ago, demonstrated how quickly Canada and the U.S. can mobilize Canadian nationalism amid tense trade negotiations. Any Olympic ice hockey matchup between the two countries will feed into the national imagination of both countries and their political leaders.
> Denmark and the U.S. are also in the same group in the men’s ice hockey tournament, meaning they are guaranteed to play each other in the round-robin phase.
> The men’s ice hockey tournament at the 1980 winter Olympics in Lake Placid, N.Y., served as a pivotal moment in the Cold War. When the underdog U.S. beat the favoured Soviet Union Red Army team, it was deemed the “Miracle on Ice.”
> Given Trump’s threats against Greenland, a Danish territory, the Olympics matchup between the two teams could serve as Denmark’s own “miracle on ice” moment.
> Beyond ice hockey, this is shaping up to be a Winter Olympics the U.S. is likely to perform quite well in. Traditional winter powerhouses Norway and Russia are both facing scandals or exclusion.
> Norway, the all-time leader in medals in Winter Olympics history, is facing a massive cheating scandal in ski jumping but is generally a powerhouse in the nordic sports and skiing events. Russian athletes remain barred from competing under their national flag due to the war in Ukraine and are only permitted to participate as vetted Individual Neutral Athletes.
> Trump is likely to make a big deal about any strong American performance, framing any success in contrast to both the EU and Canada.
> During his second term in office, Trump has welcomed numerous athletes to the White House and publicly linked sporting success to national strength. He celebrated American participation at the Ryder Cup golf tournament and the 4 Nations Face-off, even when those contests ended in U.S. defeats.
> A successful Winter Olympics could therefore provide political capital at a sensitive moment. Amid his attack on Venezuela and stated goal of acquiring Greenland, major soccer countries and EU powerbrokers — including France and Germany — have started to tentatively reconsider their participation in the 2026 Men’s World Cup, hosted in large part by the U.S.
> But first, the 2026 Winter Olympics will serve up a menu of matchups that stand to serve the nationalist goals of Trump, Carney and leaders across the European Union.

> Hedge funds increased net-long Brent crude positions by more than 31,000 contracts in the week ending February 3, lifting total long positions to nearly 278,000 lots, the highest level in roughly ten months. Data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission shows that money managers also raised net-long positions in WTI crude to a six-month high, reversing the defensive stance that dominated late 2025.

More recent positioning appears to suggest that traders could again be prioritizing geopolitical risk premiums over inventory trends or near-term demand signals.
> Bloomberg data shows hedge funds are adding new long positions while also cutting back on short bets, pointing to a broader return to bullish crude exposure rather than a reshuffling of existing trades. The increase has been strongest in Brent contracts, which tend to react more directly to Middle East supply risks than U.S.-based oil benchmarks.

## 📌 Topic: China Economic Outlook
*(Found 5 articles)*

### 1. [Three keys to China's outlook in 2026](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202602/09/WS698934b9a310d6866eb382eb.html)
**Source**: China Daily | **Date**: 2026-02-09T01:13:00+00:00

> As China enters 2026, the first year of its 15th Five-Year Plan (2026-30) period, the country's economic debate is undergoing a quiet but significant shift. The focus is no longer narrowly on how to sustain headline growth, but increasingly on how such growth is generated, distributed and anchored in social realities. Recent policy signals suggest that China's next phase of economic management will be shaped less by short-term stimulus logic and more by structural reorientation — placing people, policy coordination and external conditions at the center of the discussion.
> At the heart of the upcoming five-year plan lies a recalibrated development philosophy. While the previous planning cycle emphasized the "dual circulation" framework — strengthening domestic demand while remaining open to global markets — the new framework sharpens two priorities. One is the balance between improving economic quality and maintaining reasonable growth. The other, more fundamental shift is the explicit elevation of human development as both the means and the ultimate goal of economic policy.
> This people-centric orientation reflects a recognition that China's traditional growth drivers are changing. As demographic dividends diminish, the policy challenge is no longer solved by expanding physical investment alone. Instead, economic sustainability increasingly depends on how effectively the country invests in people — both in quantitative terms, such as stabilizing population trends, and in qualitative terms, through long-term investment in education, healthcare and human capital. The emphasis is not simply social in nature. It is economic at its core, shaping productivity, innovation and consumption capacity over time.
> Changing demand patterns reinforce this shift. As income levels rise, households naturally move beyond basic material needs toward services, experiences and personal development. This transition, long described in economic theory, is now becoming a defining feature of China's demand structure. In response, policymakers are signaling a greater role for the services sector, not as a supplement to industry, but as a central pillar of future growth. Expanding and upgrading services is increasingly seen as essential to matching supply with the population's evolving expectations of a better quality of life.
> Urbanization further illustrates how people-centric thinking intersects with macroeconomic objectives. From the household perspective, urbanization offers access to better public services and opportunities. From the broader economy's perspective, it enables a more efficient allocation of labor and capital.
> Recent policy discussions on providing basic public services based on actual place of residence, rather than formal household registration, reflect continuity with a more inclusive, human-oriented approach to urban development. International comparisons suggest that China still has room to advance in this area, particularly when measured by residency rather than registration. Better spatial allocation of the existing population suggests that bridging this gap is not just a social imperative, but also a critical lever to unlock domestic demand, supporting both consumption growth and real estate market stabilization.
> Ultimately, this shift reframes the goal of development itself. Improving livelihoods and advancing broadly shared prosperity are no longer peripheral aspirations, but central benchmarks of success. In this context, frequently debated measures — such as subsidies for first-time homebuyers or the long-term expansion and quality improvement of higher education — are best understood not as isolated interventions, but as part of a broader strategy to unlock demand by investing in people.
> Alongside this conceptual shift, 2026 is likely to mark a stronger emphasis on policy coordination. Recent official language has repeatedly highlighted the need to generate a combined effect from existing policy tools and new initiatives, while ensuring consistency across economic and noneconomic measures. This reflects growing awareness that policy effectiveness depends as much on transmission and alignment as on headline phenomena.
> From a fiscal perspective, accumulated policy space remains substantial. In recent years, fiscal deposits have risen sharply, pointing to inefficiencies or bottlenecks in translating available resources into actual spending. When existing funds are not effectively deployed, introducing additional stimulus risks running into the same constraints. Improving efficiency of what is already on balance sheets may therefore matter as much as expanding the balance sheet itself.
> A similar logic applies to State-owned assets. Despite well-documented local government debt pressures, the consolidated balance sheets of State-owned enterprises reveal a vast stock of assets and financial capacity by international standards. The key constraint is liquidity and institutional design rather than sheer scale. Financial instruments such as REITs remain constrained by regulatory and tax frameworks, while some policy-oriented assets generate relatively low returns. Unlocking this potential will require coordinated action — combining supportive monetary conditions, credit enhancement mechanisms and targeted institutional reform — rather than reliance on any single policy lever.
> Policy coordination also matters where existing and new measures may pull in opposite directions. Real estate offers a clear example: expanding land supply may ease fiscal pressure but worsen inventory overhangs, while restricting supply may stabilize prices but constrain revenue. Without a unified framework to assess such trade-offs, well-intended policies risk undermining one another. The growing emphasis on consistency assessment reflects an attempt to manage these tensions more systematically.
> External conditions, particularly the renminbi's exchange rate, form the third layer of the 2026 outlook. While markets broadly expect appreciation, views differ on its pace and scale. What matters most is sequencing. Currency appreciation, if not accompanied by stronger domestic demand, could exacerbate existing imbalances by dampening exports and encouraging imports. For this reason, demand-expansion policies must move at least in step with, and ideally ahead of, exchange rate adjustments.
> Current undervaluation of the renminbi, to the extent it exists, appears difficult to explain purely through economic fundamentals. Interest rate differentials and purchasing power parity would ordinarily point toward a stronger currency. The divergence suggests the influence of noneconomic factors, most notably geopolitical tensions. Investment restrictions, heightened scrutiny of China-related business exposure, and export controls have produced a chilling effect on capital flows, contributing to exchange rate pressure through market channels rather than policy manipulation.
> The stability of China's foreign exchange reserves underscores this point. Recent movements reflect market supply and demand dynamics rather than administrative intervention, a reality implicitly acknowledged by the absence of a "currency manipulation" designation. Research suggests that even limited financial sanctions can exert meaningful pressure on exchange rates, reinforcing the link between geopolitics and currency valuation.
> Looking ahead, a gradual stabilization of external relations — particularly between China and the United States — is expected to help correct these distortions. Any appreciation that follows would represent a normalization of expectations rather than a policy-driven shift.
> Taken together, the outlook for 2026 points to a more nuanced phase of economic management. Growth will matter, but so will its composition, its beneficiaries and its resilience. By placing people at the center, improving policy coordination and navigating a complex external environment, China's economic agenda is moving toward a model that prioritizes sustainability over speed and coherence over short-term performance.

### 2. [China: Economic outlook under pressure - Commerzbank](https://www.fxstreet.com/news/china-economic-outlook-under-pressure-commerzbank-202602021006)
**Source**: FXStreet | **Date**: 2026-02-02T10:06:00+00:00

> Commerzbank's Economic Research report highlights the ongoing struggles of the Chinese economy, with both the manufacturing and services sectors slipping into contraction territory. The official purchasing managers' indices for January 2026 indicate a weak start to the year, with GDP growth expected to slow to 4.0% in 2026. The report emphasizes the need for further economic stimulus measures from the government in Beijing.
> "The official Chinese purchasing managers' indices (PMI) for January 2026 were worse than expected, signaling a weak start to the new year. Both the manufacturing and service sectors unexpectedly slipped into contraction territory (values below 50 points)."
> "We expect GDP growth to slow to 4.0% in 2026 (2025: 5.0%). The weak January figures are increasing pressure on the government in Beijing to introduce further economic stimulus measures."
> "Interestingly, the private RatingDog Manufacturing PMI (which surveys more smaller, private export-oriented companies) rose slightly from 50.1 to 50.3 points. This suggests that large state-owned enterprises in particular are suffering from weak domestic demand, while the export sector is showing some resilience."

> EUR/USD retains a firm underlying bid, surpassing the 1.1900 mark as the NA session draws to a close on Monday. The pair’s persistent uptrend comes as the US Dollar remains on the defensive, with traders staying cautious ahead of upcoming US NFP prints and CPI data.
> GBP/USD is clocking decent gains at the start of the week, advancing to three-day highs near 1.3670 and building on Friday’s solid performance. The better tone in the British Pound comes on the back of the intense sekk-off in the Greenback and despite re-emerging signs of a fresh government crisis in the UK.
> The daily chart shows spot Gold in a parabolic uptrend that accelerated sharply from the $4,600 area in late January, printing a record high at $5,598.25 before a violent reversal erased nearly $1,000 in value during the final days of the month.
> Following a strong downtrend across the crypto market over the past week, Litecoin holders are under immense pressure. The Bitcoin fork has trimmed about $1.81 billion from its market capitalization since the beginning of the year, sending it below the top 20 cryptos by market cap.
> I do not think I would be exaggerating to say that Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s snap general election gamble paid off over the weekend – and then some. This secured the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) an unprecedented mandate just three months into her tenure.
> Ripple (XRP) is extending its intraday decline to around $1.40 at the time of writing on Monday amid growing pressure from the retail market and risk-off sentiment that continues to keep investors on the sidelines.

### 3. [India-US Trade Deal: Economic Gains and Geopolitical Shifts](https://www.outlookindia.com/international/india-us-trade-deal-economic-gains-and-geopolitical-shifts)
**Source**: Outlook India | **Date**: 2026-02-04T17:56:00+00:00

> The deal cuts tariffs from 50 to 18 per cent, opening the US market and attracting technology and investment.
> Closer ties with Washington help India counter China’s growing assertiveness and strengthen Quad cooperation.
> India maintains relations with Russia, but engagement with the US signals a gradual tilt in foreign policy alignment.
> The devil, as always, is in the details and for now there is very little of it. Yet the emerging India-US trade pact, whenever it is finally concluded, will reshape more than just trade and tariffs but will also have geopolitical implications.
> India will not announce a clean break from its old balancing act, and public messaging will continue to emphasise strategic autonomy. In practice, however, New Delhi appears to be edging closer to Washington, not just for access to investments and the lucrative American market but also for strategic consideration and China’s muscle-flexing across the disputed 3,488-km border with India.
> That process began nearly 25 years ago when India-US ties got a fillip after Bill Clinton’s visit in 2000 and the clinching of the India-US nuclear deal during Manmohan Singh’s tenure. Bilateral ties got a jolt with Trump’s tariff war last year and the US tilt towards Pakistan after the Sindoor operation. Now, with the announcement of a trade deal and lowering tariffs from 50 per cent to a reasonable 18 per cent, a new chapter in cooperation has begun.
> “The deal’s significance is geopolitical too. It cools one major front so that India can address its real endurance test from the north, where pressure is applied at the border, by technology denial, and through influence campaigns in the neighborhood below conflict level,’’ says Syed Akbaruddin, India’s former envoy to the UN, without naming China.
> The importance of the US for India’s development cannot be overstated. New Delhi needs US investments and  technology to create jobs and expand trade to leap-frog India and its teeming millions to become a developed country by 2047.
> The assertive rise of China as an economic and military power ready to challenge US supremacy has led to bipartisan support in Washington for aligning with India. “The US also sees India as a continued balancer of its China and  Indo-Pacific strategies and hence there is a mutual strategic dependence,’’ says retired diplomat Anil Wadhwa.
> China’s repeated aggressive moves against India, culminating in a military confrontation in Ladakh in the summer of 2020, has also pushed successive governments in New Delhi to look to Washington.  The Quad grouping of the US, India, Australia and Japan, is an attempt to contain China. India will take a decade and more to catch up with China’s defence capabilities, and is therefore working with the US could help blunt China’s moves in Asia.
> Where does this leave Russia, India’s traditional longtime partner? During Russian President Vladimir Putin’s visit to New Delhi in December, the warmth between him and Prime Minister Narendra Modi was on full display. Indians, cutting across all sections, regard Russia as one of the country’s loyal friends. What happens to ties with Moscow? “There is an understanding in the highest political level. Russia is deeply ingrained in the Indian system. The trade deal with the US won’t make much of a difference. It is a unique relationship, not dependent on a third country,’’ says Talmiz Ahmad, former ambassador to Saudi Arabia and the UAE.
> Russia would have been in the know about the deal and also India’s compulsions on not buying Russian oil. Though oil purchases have been substantially reduced some oil is still sourced from private traders, outside the two main entities that were recently sanctioned by the Trump administration.
> “There will be no dramatic rupture but greater distance, though the two countries will continue to work together on several issues, including reform of multilateral institutions, including UN reforms, defence, space and several other key areas,’’ says Nandan Unnikrishnan of the Observer Research Foundation.
> “India's relations with Russia will remain on even keel. The oil purchases were necessitated and facilitated due to a set of factors which included large discounts on Russian oil. Since that arbitrage has shrunk, India should buy from whichever source feasible and reasonable since it is a large energy importer,’’ Wadhwa adds.
> Strategic autonomy has been the guiding principle of India’s foreign policy since Independence, and it has served New Delhi well. But the political leadership, whether of the Congress or the BJP have tried to have a toe-hold in both the US and Russian camps. However, the West, through its punitive sanctions against Moscow, following the annexation of Crimea and the Ukraine war has pushed Russia deeper and deeper into China’s arms.
> Despite the fond hopes of the Indian establishment, and yearning to return to the good old days of strategic autonomy, India-Russia ties are bound to suffer as New Delhi gradually inches closer to the US. The West has pushed Russia, through its crippling sanction regime, deeper into China’s arms.
> Pragmatism demands closer ties with the US. India will continue its balancing act as far as it can sustain it, however strategic autonomy will survive more as a narrative than as a policy. Diplomacy may speak one language while hard-nosed international politics will dictate alignment. But a question that haunts India is whether the US, more so the temperamental Donald Trump can be trusted.

### 4. [China Markets Weigh Credit Tightening Against Growth Momentum](https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/china-markets-weigh-credit-tightening-against-growth-momentum-1576799)
**Source**: FX Empire | **Date**: 2026-02-03T02:41:00+00:00

> Mainland China’s CSI 300 and SSE Composite Index joined the broader market sell-off, as Chinese regulators tightened credit controls amid concerns over excess leverage and overheating.
> Metals and mining sector stocks came under heavy selling pressure as gold and silver plunged late last week, extending their losses into this week.
> Meanwhile, hopes for near-term fresh stimulus and monetary policy easing abated, as Chinese PMI data signaled robust momentum early in 2026.
> Despite the pullback from January’s highs, the medium-term outlook remains bullish for Mainland and Hong Kong-listed stocks.
> Below, I will explore the key drivers behind recent gains, the medium-term (3-6 months) market outlook, and the key technical levels traders should watch.
> In January, China’s major stock exchanges raised their minimum margin requirements to address excess leverage, aimed at cooling an overheating market and tackling speculative trades.
> Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen increased their minimum margin requirements from 80% to 100%, effective January 19. The exchanges had lowered margin requirements to 80% in 2023 to support the markets.
> Notably, the CSI 300 dropped from its January 13 high of 4,837 to a January 27 low of 4,676 in response to the announcement.
> On January 30, gold and silver saw heavy losses and extended their declines on February 2, adding to the market doom and gloom. Gold tumbled 9.16% on January 30 and by a further 4.6% on February 2. Meanwhile, silver tumbled 26.83% on January 30 and by 6.4% on February 2, sending Chinese commodity-linked stocks deep into negative territory.
> Reports of counterparty Xu Maohua (“The Hat”) fleeing the country intensified the selling pressure on Chinese metal stocks. CN Wire reported:
> “Chinese metal traders lost at least 1 billion yuan (144 million) after counterparty Xu Maohua (“The Hat”) fled the country, leaving trades unfinished, raising regulatory concerns over hidden financial risks. […] The incident has drawn scrutiny from China’s state-owned assets watchdog, which instructed major commodities SOEs to review operations and cut non-core revenue boosting activities. The Watchdog’s measures could reduce liquidity and increase pressure on small traders.”
> The FTSE China A 600 Mining Index slid 7.8% on January 30 and by 9.25% on February 2.
> The mining sector sell-off contributed to the CSI 300’s fall to a February 2 low of 4,614, its lowest level since December 24.
> Chinese economic indicators added to the negative market sentiment on February 2. The RatingDog China General Manufacturing PMI increased from 50.1 in December to 50.3 in January. Key highlights from the January survey included:
> Crucially, improving demand and rising employment may ease pressure on Beijing to roll out fresh stimulus and ease monetary policy. Typically, higher prices widen profit margins, enabling firms to raise wages. Tighter labor market conditions and rising wages may boost private consumption, bolstering the second part of China’s dual economy.
> In January, Beijing announced fresh measures to boost domestic consumption targeting autos, home appliances, electronics, and smart durable goods. Beijing also aimed at households, pledging several measures, including:
> While there was a welcome upswing in demand and employment, manufacturers were less optimistic in January, underscoring the need for further policy support from Beijing.
> RatingDog founder Yao Yu commented on the January PMI survey, stating:
> “Looking ahead, if cost pressures persist while demand recovery is limited, profit margins will remain under pressure. Policy support for initiatives may consolidate the recovery momentum in 2026.”
> Despite the bullish sentiment, downside risks could derail the positive outlook. These include:
> These scenarios would likely send the Hang Seng Index below its 50-day EMA and the CSI 300 below its 200-day EMAs, indicating bearish trend reversals.
> However, China’s advancements in AI, self-reliance on chip manufacturing, and improving manufacturing sector activity support a constructive short- to medium-term bias for Mainland China indices.
> Furthermore, economists expect that Beijing can boost domestic consumption by introducing new subsidies and lowering borrowing rates, while bolstering the housing market.
> Chart technicals and market fundamentals remained diverged in early trading on Tuesday, February 3. Viewing the daily chart, the CSI 300 trades below its 50-day EMA, but holds above its 200-day EMA. The EMA positions signal a bearish near-term but bullish longer-term bias.
> A breakout above the 4,650 resistance level and the 50-day EMA would signal a near-term bullish trend reversal. A bullish trend reversal would bring the January 13 high of 4,837 into play. A sustained move through 4,837 would enable the bulls to target 5,000. Breaking above the 50-day EMA will be crucial for the bullish outlook.
> The Hang Seng Index’s outlook contrasts with the CSI 300, as the Index trades above its 50-day and 200-day EMAs. These EMAs signal bullish momentum, aligning with favorable fundamentals.
> A break above January’s high of 27,207 would bring the October 2025 high of 27,382 into play. A move through 27,382 would pave the way toward 28,000. Breaking down resistance at 28,000 would open the door to testing 30,000 for the first time since 2021.
> To summarize, the short- and medium-term outlook remains constructive. Beijing’s recent policy measures, expectations of further support, albeit delayed, China’s AI-linked advancements, and a pickup in manufacturing sector activity are likely to drive demand for Mainland China and Hong Kong-listed stocks.
> However, global trade headlines, housing market developments, and price trends are likely crucial for domestic consumption. Effective policy measures targeting domestic consumption would likely send the CSI 300 to its 2021 all-time high of 5,931.

### 5. [Trump Warns UK Over China As Starmer Secures Economic Deals In Beijing](https://www.outlookindia.com/international/trump-warns-uk-over-china-as-starmer-secures-economic-deals-in-beijing)
**Source**: Outlook India | **Date**: 2026-01-30T17:07:00+00:00

> Trump warns UK it is “very dangerous” to pursue closer China ties.
> Starmer secures lower tariffs, investment deals, and improved market access in Beijing.
> UK aims to balance economic relations with China while maintaining strong US ties.
> US President Donald Trump has cautioned the United Kingdom that closer economic ties with China are “very dangerous”, just hours after Prime Minister Keir Starmer hailed progress during a visit to Beijing.
> Starmer, the first British prime minister to travel to the Chinese capital in eight years, met Xi Jinping for three hours at the Great Hall of the People, promising a “more sophisticated” relationship with China and securing improved market access, lower tariffs, and investment deals. According to The Guardian, the visit marked a thaw in previously strained relations.
> Speaking in Washington about Starmer’s engagement with Beijing, Trump said: “Well, it’s very dangerous for them to do that.” His comments are likely to create concern in Downing Street, given Trump’s unpredictability and long-standing hostility towards China. One UK official told The Guardian that the US had been aware of the trip and the country’s objectives in advance.
> After his meeting with Xi, Starmer said the UK’s relationship with China was in a “good, strong place” and that his talks had delivered “just the level of engagement that we hoped for”. Addressing the UK-China Business Forum at the Bank of China, he added: “We warmly engaged and made some real progress, actually, because the UK has got a huge amount to offer.”
> Chris Torrens, chair of the British Chamber of Commerce in China, described Starmer’s visit as “successful”, telling the BBC: “It makes sense for UK to be looking to China, it’s one of its larger trading partners.” Starmer is scheduled to travel to Shanghai before leaving for Tokyo to meet Japanese counterpart Sanae Takaichi for a working dinner.
> The Guardian reported that Starmer’s trip follows visits by several western leaders seeking to strengthen ties with the world’s second-largest economy while hedging against the unpredictability of the US president. Trump’s recent actions—including threats of trade tariffs and his pledge to take control of Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark—have unsettled longstanding allies.
> Earlier this week, Trump warned Canada over economic deals with China, saying: “Even more dangerous, I think, for Canada. Canada is not doing well. They’re doing very poorly, and you can’t look at China as the answer.”
> Trump also noted his personal rapport with Xi, saying: “President Xi is a friend of mine, I know him very well.” The US president is expected to visit Beijing himself in April; the United States remains China’s largest single trading partner.
> Before departing for Beijing, Starmer told Bloomberg that Britain would not have to choose between the US and China, asserting that the country could deepen economic relations with China without harming ties with Washington. “We’ve got very close relations with the US – of course, we want to – and we will maintain that business, alongside security and defence,” he said.
> Meanwhile, US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick expressed scepticism about Starmer’s efforts with China. “The Chinese are the greatest exporters and they are very, very difficult when you’re trying to export to them,” he told reporters. “So good luck if the British are trying to export to China ... it’s just unlikely.” He downplayed the risk of Trump imposing tariffs on the UK, adding: “Unless the prime minister of Britain sort of takes on the United States and says very difficult things, I doubt it.”
> The Guardian reported that Starmer’s visit comes amid a broader push by western nations to strengthen engagement with Beijing, even as they navigate an unpredictable US foreign policy.

### 1. [AI, quantum and clean tech investment trends 2026](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/ai-quantum-clean-tech-investment-163015654.html)
**Source**: Yahoo | **Date**: 2026-02-06T17:08:00+00:00

> The investment landscape is undergoing a transformation as emerging technologies transition from experimental concepts to commercially viable opportunities.
> Recent market developments highlight accelerating momentum across artificial intelligence infrastructure, quantum computing, renewable energy systems, and biotechnology platforms.
> Meanwhile, quantum computing equities have experienced gains exceeding almost 1,900% over 2025. These developments signal a pivotal moment for investors seeking exposure to next-generation innovations that are reshaping global markets and economic structures, Plus500 reports.
> AI infrastructure spending by major technology firms is driving structural economic shifts, with the generative AI market projected to reach $400 billion by 2031
> The quantum computing sector has witnessed extraordinary growth, with specialist firms posting 1,900% in 2025 gains despite limited commercial applications
> Renewable energy additions reached record levels in 2024 at 858 terawatt-hours, with solar efficiency improvements to 25-30% through perovskite-silicon technology
> Gene therapy platforms are expanding from $2.18 billion (2024) to a projected $9.05 billion by 2034
> Green hydrogen economy attracts $2.5-$11.7 trillion in projected investment by 2050, though European projects face near-term commercial challenges
> AI data centre expansion reshapes economic fundamentals
> The AI infrastructure buildout represents one of the most substantial capital expenditure cycles in modern economic history. Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, and Amazon are collectively investing tens of billions in data centre infrastructure, fundamentally altering U.S. economic growth patterns. Some analysts believe that AI infrastructure has emerged as "a new pillar of economic growth," with capital deployment creating measurable impacts on employment, industrial production, and regional development.
> The generative AI market alone is forecast to expand from $59.01 billion in 2025 to $400 billion by 2031, representing a compound annual growth rate of 37.57%. This growth trajectory extends beyond software applications into physical infrastructure, semiconductor manufacturing, and power generation capacity specifically designed for AI workloads.
> Market valuation concerns and profitability questions
> Despite robust growth metrics, market observers are evaluating whether current AI valuations reflect sustainable business models or speculative excess. BlackRock's analysis addresses concerns about an AI bubble by examining three critical factors: real profits, capital efficiency, and mass adoption rates. The investment manager notes that, unlike previous technology bubbles, leading AI companies are generating substantial revenues and positive cash flows, though questions remain about the timeline for smaller AI-focused firms to achieve profitability.
> Morningstar's November 2025 stock market outlook emphasises that "AI mega-caps drive valuation surge," suggesting that whilst large technology firms with diversified AI capabilities command premium valuations, investors should scrutinise which companies can "utilise AI to improve their products and services" rather than simply participate in AI-related marketing narratives.
> Extraordinary market performance with limited commercial deployment
> The quantum computing sector has experienced unprecedented investor enthusiasm, with Rigetti Computing and D-Wave Quantum posting gains exceeding 1,900% over 12 months despite having "few real-world applications and not being close to generating a profit.” This disconnect between market performance and commercial readiness illustrates both the transformative potential of quantum technologies and the speculative nature of early-stage innovation markets.
> Rigetti Computing announced in September 2025 that it secured purchase orders totaling approximately $5.7 million for two 9-qubit Novera quantum computing systems, representing tangible commercial traction albeit at modest scale. Meanwhile, Xanadu projects significant technological advances with up to 100,000 physical qubits and 1,000 logical qubits in development for fault-tolerant quantum computing systems.
> Investment case and risk considerations
> McKinsey projects the quantum computing market could exceed $100 billion in total value, driven by applications in drug discovery, advanced manufacturing, cybersecurity, financial modelling, and logistics optimization. A J.P. Morgan survey of 500 business leaders found that approximately three in five enterprises are exploring quantum opportunities, particularly in quantum AI applications.
> However, the sector presents substantial risks. Current quantum systems remain extremely sensitive to environmental interference, require temperatures near absolute zero, and have yet to demonstrate "quantum advantage" for commercially relevant problems at scale. Investopedia characterises the recent market rally as driven by speculators rather than fundamental business performance, noting the absence of near-term profitability for pure-play quantum firms.
> Solar and wind additions reach historic levels
> Renewable energy capacity additions achieved unprecedented scale in 2024, with new installations contributing a record 858 terawatt-hours of useful energy output. Solar technologies incorporating perovskite-silicon cells have pushed conversion efficiencies to 25-30%, though deployment at a commercial scale remains in early stages.
> The International Energy Agency's latest World Energy Outlook confirms that renewable energy, led by solar power, "will grow faster than any other major source in the next few years," driven by declining costs, policy support, and grid integration technologies. KPMG research indicates that 72% of investors are accelerating energy transition investments, with 64% focusing on energy efficiency and 56% on renewable energy systems.
> Investment patterns and market dynamics
> Despite renewable energy's growth trajectory, investment patterns remain complex. The same KPMG survey reveals that 75% of investors maintain positions in fossil fuel assets, reflecting diversification strategies and recognition that energy transition timelines extend over decades rather than years. Clean energy investments are projected to reach $2.2 trillion globally in 2025, though progress remains "mostly stuck in carbon capture, hydrogen fuels, and heavy industry" applications.
> Moreover, some sources suggest that maintaining current solar growth rates whilst "stepping up on wind" represents the critical challenge for meeting tripling targets established under international climate commitments.
> Trillion-dollar opportunity with commercial hurdles
> The green hydrogen economy is attracting substantial long-term capital commitments, with projected cumulative investment between $2.5 trillion and $11.7 trillion by 2050. Plug Power reported third-quarter 2025 revenue of $177 million, "driven by continued strength in Plug's electrolyser business" and volume growth in hydrogen fuel sales.
> The company has commenced installation of a 5-megawatt electrolyser system for H2 Hollandia, positioned to become the largest green hydrogen initiative in the Netherlands and marking Plug's first commercial electrolyser deployment in that market.
> Reality check for European projects
> Despite progress indicators, reports revealed that hydrogen developers in Europe are "reckoning with reality check," with nearly 18 gigawatts of renewables-powered electrolytic hydrogen production projects at advanced stages as of Q2 2025 facing economic and regulatory challenges. McKinsey's energy transition assessment confirms that hydrogen fuels remain among the technologies where "progress is mostly stuck," indicating significant technical and commercial obstacles to widespread adoption.
> Market expansion and technology advances
> The global gene therapy platform market was valued at $2.18 billion in 2024 and is projected to expand to $9.05 billion by 2034, driven by "advancements in CRISPR and personalized medicine.” More specifically, the AAV (adeno-associated virus) gene therapy market was estimated at $2.75 billion in 2024 and is expanding at a 15.24% compound annual growth rate through 2034.
> SNS Insider projects the gene therapy platform market will reach $7.50 billion by 2032, attributing growth to "rapid advances in CRISPR and viral vector technologies" that enable more precise genetic modifications for treating inherited disorders, certain cancers, and rare diseases.
> Investment and development dynamics
> The regenerative medicine sector more broadly is experiencing rapid demand growth "due to its personalized treatment approach, which provides more effective management of conditions" ranging from orthopaedic injuries to degenerative diseases. However, Bio-Techne's presentation at the UBS Global Healthcare Conference highlighted both opportunities and "hurdles" in navigating growth amid sector challenges.
> Voyager Therapeutics' report indicates strategic prioritization decisions, noting that "investment in the SOD1-ALS gene therapy and anti-Aβ antibody gene therapy programs has been deprioritized to focus on the new discovery programs.” Such portfolio adjustments reflect the capital-intensive nature of biotechnology development and the need for focused resource allocation.
> Emerging portfolio diversification patterns
> Deloitte's 2026 investment management outlook identifies several structural shifts reshaping portfolio construction: "ETFs surge, hedge funds pivot, and private capital repositions as industry lines blur and product models evolve.” Schwab Asset Management's 2025 "ETFs and Beyond" study found that 62% of ETF investors "can envision putting their entire investment portfolios into ETFs," with half indicating such transitions could occur within five years.
> World Finance Informs identifies "key trends shaping institutional investment strategies in 2025 include digital assets, private markets, AI innovation, and diversified portfolio approaches.” This convergence of traditional and emerging asset classes reflects institutional recognition that next-generation technologies require exposure across multiple investment vehicles and risk profiles.
> Due diligence and risk management frameworks
> Investors evaluating next-generation technology opportunities should consider several factors:
> Technology readiness levels: Distinguish between laboratory-stage innovations, pilot deployments, and commercially scalable solutions. Quantum computing and certain gene therapies remain in early commercial phases despite market enthusiasm.
> Revenue generation vs. addressable market: Evaluate whether companies demonstrate actual revenue growth or primarily present total addressable market projections. The disparity between quantum computing valuations and current revenues exemplifies this consideration.
> Capital requirements and burn rates: Next-generation technologies often require sustained capital investment before achieving profitability. Assess runway adequacy and financing access.
> Regulatory pathways: Gene therapies, hydrogen infrastructure, and AI applications face evolving regulatory frameworks that can significantly impact deployment timelines.
> Competitive positioning: Determine whether firms possess defensible intellectual property, strategic partnerships, or operational advantages that justify premium valuations.
> The convergence of artificial intelligence infrastructure, quantum computing advances, renewable energy deployment, green hydrogen development, and biotechnology breakthroughs creates a complex landscape for investors seeking exposure to next-generation innovations. Market data from November 2025 confirms substantial capital flows into these sectors, with the generative AI market alone projected to reach $400 billion by 2031 and clean energy investments exceeding $2.2 trillion in 2025.
> However, extraordinary valuations in specific segments, particularly quantum computing's 1,900% gains and concerns about the formation of an AI bubble, necessitate rigorous due diligence and realistic assessments of commercialisation timelines. While solar and wind energy demonstrate proven deployment capabilities, hydrogen technologies and advanced biotechnology platforms remain in earlier development stages, despite having compelling long-term potential.
> Investors should adopt diversified approaches across technology maturity stages, recognizing that revolutionary innovations typically require extended periods to achieve mainstream adoption and sustainable profitability. The distinction between transformative technological potential and investable commercial reality remains critical for portfolio construction in this dynamic environment.

### 2. [6 Trends In Tech And Startups We're Watching In 2026, From An IPO Boom To More Huge AI Deals](https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/2026-tech-startup-trends-ipo-ai-ma/)
**Source**: Crunchbase News | **Date**: 2026-01-30T12:12:00+00:00

> Last year was the third-strongest on record for global venture funding, trailing only the peaks in 2021 and 2022. It was also a surprisingly strong year for IPOs and we saw an uptick in startup M&A numbers.
> All that sets the stage for what the industry insiders we spoke with expect will be another robust year for startup investment, acquisitions and new public-market listings. At the same time, there’s growing concern about capital concentration as venture dollars accumulate in a relatively small cohort of companies, many of them based in the San Francisco Bay Area.
> With that, here’s a closer look at six trends we expect to see unfold in 2026.
> Although the IPO window didn’t stay open the whole year, 2025 turned into an unexpectedly strong one for new offerings. At least 23 U.S.-based companies listed above $1 billion in value in 2025 compared to nine in 2024. Total valuations at IPO price for those billion-dollar listings reached at least $125 billion — more than doubling year over year.
> This year, experts we spoke with expect that momentum to continue. In this market, “a profitable company — particularly one that either is an AI play or has a good story of how AI will be a tailwind for their business — are good candidates for a 2026 IPO,” Aman Singh, a corporate partner at Fenwick & West who was involved with the CoreWeave, Figma and Navan IPOs, told my colleague Gené Teare in late December.
> Among the companies most closely watched for potential offerings this year are fintech unicorns such as Plaid and Revolut, and buzzy AI companies including OpenAI, Databricks and Cohere.
> Still, in the first month of this year, some of that enthusiasm has tempered. As contributing reporter Joanna Glasner notes, even when open, the IPO window is always just a quick market turn from slamming shut once again.
> So while a new offering from a buzzy company like SpaceX or OpenAI would help prop the window open, more humdrum IPOs from run-of-the-mill enterprise SaaS startups probably won’t be enough to fuel a new IPO boom.
> Startup acquisitions are also expected to become more common this year, especially if the IPO market does gain steam.
> “A healthy IPO market tends to increase M&A activity rather than reduce it,” Anuj Bahal, technology, media and telecoms deal advisory and strategy leader for KPMG US, told contributing reporter Mary Ann Azevedo. “Many companies pursue dual-track strategies, simultaneously preparing for an IPO while exploring M&A, which gives them greater flexibility and leverage in negotiations. The threat of a public offering can be used as a bargaining chip to drive up a startup’s sale price.”
> Last year, there were around 2,300 M&A deals for venture-backed startups, per Crunchbase data. Industry insiders we spoke with said they expect dealmaking to continue at a steady pace in 2026, in part as larger companies make strategic buys for startup talent, and as startups last funded in the boom five years ago look for exit opportunities.
> “On the one hand, big corporates are snapping up seed/Series A startups for talent and tech — we can call that the AI acqui-hire trend. Many teams with fewer than 100 employees have landed $100 million-plus exits,” Lukas Hoebarth, EY-Parthenon Americas technology sector leader, told us. “On the other hand, a cohort of 3- to 6-year-old unicorns that stalled on IPO plans is finally selling.”
> Four investors who spoke with Mary Ann all concurred that they expect another uptick in venture funding this year, with predictions ranging from a 10% to 25% year-over-year increase.
> Those investors expect funding in 2026 will continue to concentrate into AI-related companies and adjacent sectors such as robotics and defense tech, at the expense of areas like climate tech, crypto and vertical AI that doesn’t have a strong differentiation or moat.
> “Last year demonstrated that it’s difficult to survive as an AI wrapper company,” George Mathew, managing director at Insight Partners told Mary Ann last month. “Even the vertical AI providers have to be deeply embedded into industry workflows to differentiate themselves from a foundation model doing more of the repetitive work in the market.”
> Many of the investors also said they expect capital to concentrate on two ends of the startup spectrum: big growth rounds for established players to maintain a market lead, and larger seed and early-stage deals to promising startups that look poised to disrupt.
> “I expect net new dollars to concentrate more in seed and growth deals, primarily because the seed rounds are getting quite large thanks to fundraises by the likes of neolabs, neoclouds, and others. Furthermore, the capital needs of existing high-growth companies will continue to grow due to dependencies on frontier lab and hardware spend,” Menlo Ventures partner Tim Tully told us.
> Already, we’re seeing those predictions about the rise in early-stage megarounds pan out.
> Last year’s venture funding disproportionately went to a select group of companies. OpenAI, Scale AI, Anthropic, Project Prometheus and xAI each raised more than $5 billion in 2025. Altogether, those five companies raised $84 billion, or 20% of all venture funding last year — an unprecedented amount for the largest fundings in any given year, an analysis of our data shows.
> Last year was also defined by new startup records: the largest private funding round of all time ($40 billion to OpenAI), the largest private valuation ever recorded (SpaceX’s $800 billion valuation), and the largest venture-backed acquisition on record (Wiz’s $32 billion purchase by Google).
> All that’s to say: Investors placed bigger, bolder and riskier bets on a smaller cohort of companies. That capital concentration — along with the circular nature of the deals between companies such as OpenAI, Nvidia and Oracle — have heightened concerns about an AI bubble that could have far-reaching fallout for both private and public tech companies, and the global economy overall.
> AI has also prompted mass layoffs. Last year, we saw job cuts at companies including Salesforce, Microsoft and Amazon blamed at least in part on artificial intelligence.
> “I’ve reduced it from 9,000 heads to about 5,000, because I need less heads,” Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said last fall, explaining the San Francisco-based company’s decision to slash its customer-service headcount.
> All told, around 55,000 U.S. layoffs in 2025 cited AI as a factor, according to staffing firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.
> Unfortunately, we expect to see more tech employers make similar moves this year as companies focus on cutting costs and replacing some portion of their human workers with cheaper AI substitutes.
> One of the startup sectors that experienced a particularly healthy bounce last year was fintech, with funding to the sector jumping 27% year over year to $51.8 billion. Investors in the space are bullish on 2026 as well.
> Fintech VCs told Mary Ann they expect funding growth in 2026 to continue to concentrate into pre-IPO companies, for M&A to tick up, and to see robust investment into startups that add value to their fintech offerings with AI.
> Norwest Vice President Jordan Leites said he expects stablecoins, agentic payments and AI-native tools to be particularly strong areas for fintech investment this year.
> The underlying growth and performance of companies in the age of AI is “astounding and unlike anything we’ve seen before,” even relative to 2020 and 2021, Amias Gerety, partner and head of U.S. investments at QED Investors, told us.
> “Absent a broader recession, we expect some pullback and return to rationality in the funding market,” he said, “but we believe funding in fintech and at the AI application layer should remain quite strong.”
> Stay up to date with recent funding rounds, acquisitions, and more with the

### 3. [Cellebrite's 2026 Industry Trends Report Reveals Smartphones as the Leading Source of Digital Evidence in Investigations at 97%](https://www.manilatimes.net/2026/02/05/tmt-newswire/pr-newswire/cellebrites-2026-industry-trends-report-reveals-smartphones-as-the-leading-source-of-digital-evidence-in-investigations-at-97/2272619)
**Source**: The Manila Times | **Date**: 2026-02-05T13:57:00+00:00

> Smartphones: Critical to Investigations
> Smartphones are more relevant to investigations than ever before, with 97% of investigators citing them as the top source of digital evidence, up 24 points from 73% in 2024. This increase mirrors public expectations, as 97% of agency managers say communities expect digital evidence to be used in most cases.
> AI Adoption: Strong Interest, Uneven Policy Support
> Artificial intelligence (AI) is an increasingly important technology for enhancing the speed and efficiency of investigations. Sixty-five percent of public safety respondents believe AI can accelerate investigations, yet nearly a third of these respondents report their agency's policies prevent AI's use. Two-thirds of respondents cite review time as the biggest barrier to moving cases, yet AI can solve this, with respondents agreeing one of its best features is quickly analyzing communications to identify links between people.
> Public Safety: Capacity Strained as Digital Evidence Becomes Universal
> Public safety findings show 95% agree digital evidence increases case solvability, while 94% say complexity is straining caseloads. However, only 62% of agency leaders are shifting resources from legacy to digital methods. This gap between recognition and action underscores the modernization challenge agencies face.
> "The relationship between the public and the police is fundamental," stated Matt Scott, a U.K. Police and Crime Commissioner. "As new technology is introduced, it is important that the public's consent is sought and that appropriate safeguards are put in place to ensure that decision making remains in the hands of officers and staff. The relationship between the public and the police is fundamental. Any use of AI or automation in policing should follow consultation with the public and be applied only where appropriate and where it can responsibly support productivity."
> "Digital evidence is increasingly where our investigations begin," said James Howe, Detective, Columbus, Ohio, Division of Police. "This modern reality has us rethinking our workflows across the agency, not just in the lab. Digital evidence shapes how our cases are built from day one."
> "It's clear digital evidence is the backbone of modern justice," said David Gee, Chief Marketing Officer of Cellebrite. "Today's investigations involve an exponential explosion of devices, data and complexity that agencies must manage. Their only choice to evolve is to mobilize and leverage technology that will help them process evidence efficiently, while preserving the accuracy and ensuring the defensibility of evidence on which the justice system relies."
> Cloud Adoption Grows as Evidence-Sharing Risks Persist
> Using the cloud to store and share digital evidence is steadily becoming essential for agencies of all sizes. Cloud receptiveness for digital evidence management reached 42% in 2026, up from 38% in 2025. Yet physical media remains the default option with two-thirds of respondents still sharing evidence via portable hard drives and USB sticks, creating chain of custody risks and slowing cross-agency collaboration.
> Private Sector: Digital Investigations are Business-Critical
> Private sector findings show investigations embedded across business operations, with a clear shift in AI adoption from strategic intent to practical application.
> These trends have underpinned strong adoption of Cellebrite's evidence and case management investigative platform, Guardian, primarily among state and local law enforcement agencies in the United States, as well as in Latin America and the United Kingdom. In 2025, Guardian delivered triple-digit year-over-year growth across customers, users and data stored on the platform and was also recently made available to enterprise customers.

### 4. [DepEd tech-voc summit signals shift to data-driven, industry-led SHS curriculum](https://www.manilatimes.net/2026/02/09/tmt-newswire/deped-tech-voc-summit-signals-shift-to-data-driven-industry-led-shs-curriculum/2274352)
**Source**: The Manila Times | **Date**: 2026-02-09T13:05:00+00:00

> THE Department of Education (DepEd) on Wednesday announced a major pivot in its Senior High School technical-vocational (Tech-voc) program, shifting from a static curriculum to a dynamic, data-driven model aligned with real-time industry needs, as government and private sector leaders convened for the National Tech-Voc Summit in Quezon City.
> STRENGTHENING STUDENTS DepEd says insights from the summit will feed into continuous curriculum updates, enhanced work immersion standards, and deeper collaboration with industry and training institutions as part of its broader push to align basic education with national workforce priorities.  PHOTO FROM DEPED
> Representing Secretary Sonny Angara, Assistant Secretary Janir Datukan framed the gathering as a deliberate move away from static curriculum cycles toward a more responsive model that keeps pace with economic change.
> “If we truly want our students to have a bright future, we need to teach them skills that are need in the industry right now and in the future,” Datukan said in Filipino. “It’s not enough that they have work — they must have growth, skills, and a liveable wage.”
> The summit brought together education leaders, industry partners, and training institutions around five focus areas: scaling workforce development through the Enterprise-Based Education and Training (EBET) Law; aligning education with global labor trends and the future of work; using private sector data to guide curriculum and career readiness; strengthening Senior High School industry immersion; and benchmarking best practices across public and private technical-vocational institutions.
> A key moment of the summit was the plenary session on scaling national workforce development under the EBET Law, which underscored how enterprise participation can accelerate curriculum updates, improve training relevance, and expand quality work immersion opportunities. By embedding industry more deeply into training design and delivery, the EBET framework positions tech-voc education as a direct pathway to productive employment rather than a fallback option.
> This was reinforced by a plenary on data-driven workforce planning, where private sector leaders presented labor market signals that can trigger faster curriculum adjustments, particularly in sectors affected by automation, digitalization, and shifting global demand. The session highlighted how timely data can guide not only what skills are taught, but where training investments should be concentrated.
> DepEd Bureau of Curriculum Development Director Peter Marc Magsalin highlighted the role of sustained industry engagement in strengthening the school-to-work transition.
> “We must recognize that industry participation is the only way to strengthen the pipeline of school-to-work transition,” Magsalin said. “By aligning our sectoral expertise with global labor trends, we ensure our curriculum remains responsive to the future of work.”
> He also urged partners to move beyond formal commitments and speak candidly about constraints on implementation.
> “More importantly, share your challenges,” Magsalin said. “It is in being honest about our bottlenecks that we find our most innovative solutions. Beyond the data and policies, it is the camaraderie and collaboration formed in this room that will matter most. We are not just colleagues, we are fellow champions and advocates of TVET.”
