> WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump will visit China from March 31 to April 2 for high-level talks with President Xi Jinping, a trip aimed at reinforcing the trade relationship between the world’s two largest economies. The announcement came shortly before the US Supreme Court struck down many of Trump’s sweeping tariffs, including some targeting Chinese goods.

> The Beijing meeting is expected to focus on extending the trade truce that temporarily halted tariff escalation. Under the truce, China agreed to curb illicit fentanyl exports and pause restrictions on critical minerals. However, the Supreme Court ruling raises questions about the stability of US-China trade ties, as Trump had relied on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose 20% tariffs on certain Chinese exports, which the court found exceeded his authority. Tariffs under Section 301 and Section 232 remain in place.

> Trump indicated he would replace the struck-down duties with a new 10% global tariff effective for 150 days, signaling continued pressure on trading partners. Analysts say the tariff defeat weakens the US negotiating position in Beijing and may impact Chinese commitments, including large-scale purchases of US soybeans—a key concern for struggling American farmers.
> This trip will mark the first in-person talks between the leaders since their October 2025 meeting in South Korea, which largely maintained the trade truce but left sensitive issues, including Taiwan, unresolved. Washington maintains unofficial ties with Taiwan and approved an $11.1 billion arms sale in December, a move that Beijing strongly opposes.

> Experts say the Supreme Court decision could alter trade dynamics beyond China, as effective tariffs on other countries may now decline, increasing pressure on Beijing while complicating Trump’s global trade strategy. The visit is widely anticipated to be a high-profile event, with Trump promising an elaborate display of US-Chinese cooperation, even amid ongoing tensions in the bilateral relationship.

### 2. [Trump set to visit China next month after Supreme Court strikes down key tariffs](https://www.firstpost.com/world/trump-set-to-visit-china-next-month-amid-trade-tensions-13982135.html)
**Source**: Firstpost | **Date**: 2026-02-21T00:33:00+00:00

> US President Donald Trump will travel to China from March 31 to April 2 for talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing, the White House confirmed on Friday, just as the Supreme Court overturned many of the tariffs he imposed on imported goods during a global trade war.
> The visit brings together the leaders of the world’s two largest economies at a moment of renewed
> uncertainty in bilateral trade relations.
> Trump’s extended stay in Beijing had been expected to centre on prolonging a trade truce that prevented both countries from escalating tariffs further.
> However, the Supreme Court’s decision has raised fresh questions about US-China ties, which had recently steadied after Trump reduced tariffs on China in return for steps by Beijing. Those measures included action against the illicit fentanyl trade and a pause on export restrictions covering critical minerals.
> 20 per cent tariffs on China’s US-bound exports had been imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA. The Supreme Court ruled that Trump exceeded his authority under the law. The duties were linked to national emergencies concerning fentanyl distribution and trade imbalances.
> Other tariffs on Chinese goods remain in effect, including those introduced under legislated trade authorities known as Section 301 and Section 232.
> It was not immediately clear how many of the tariffs Trump would restore, but he said at a press conference that he would impose a new 10 per cent global tariff for 150 days.
> Trump’s previous visit to China in 2017 was the most recent by a US president.
> “That’s going to be a wild one,” Trump told foreign leaders visiting Washington on Thursday about the upcoming China visit. “We have to put on the biggest display you’ve ever had in the history of China.”
> The Trump administration has said the global tariffs were necessary to address national emergencies tied to trade imbalances that it argues have weakened US manufacturing.
> Scott Kennedy, a China economics expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said Trump had already been “playing defense” in the trade war, pointing to Beijing’s threat to restrict rare earth supplies. The tariff defeat likely “cements his weakness in their eyes,” he said.
> “They (Chinese officials) like the direction of travel of the bilateral relationship in which the U.S. is diminished and they want to keep things from re-escalating,” Kennedy said.
> The visit will mark the first in-person meeting between Trump and Xi since October, when they met in South Korea and agreed on the trade truce.
> Although the October meeting largely avoided the sensitive issue of Taiwan, Xi raised US arms sales to the island during a conversation with Trump this month.
> Washington approved its largest-ever arms sale to Taiwan in December, including $11.1 billion in weapons that could be used to defend against a Chinese attack. Taiwan expects additional sales.
> China regards Taiwan as its territory, a position rejected by Taipei. The US, bound by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself, maintains formal diplomatic relations with China while sustaining unofficial ties with Taiwan and serving as the island’s most important arms supplier.
> During a February call, Xi said he would consider further increasing soybean purchases, according to Trump. China is the top soybean consumer, and struggling US farmers are a significant political constituency for Trump.
> Although Trump has defended several hawkish policy measures — from Canada to Greenland and Venezuela — as necessary to counter China, he has in recent months eased policy towards Beijing in areas ranging from tariffs to advanced computer chips and drones.
> The global trade war launched after the start of his second term in January 2025 has strained relations with other trading partners, including allies.
> Critics argued that imposing steep tariffs across multiple countries insulated Beijing from the impact of the measures and reduced incentives to shift supply chains away from China.
> Martin Chorzempa, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute of International Economics, said Friday’s ruling could indirectly increase pressure on Beijing if effective tariff rates on other countries, particularly in Southeast Asia, fall more sharply than those on China.
> “Unlike with many other countries, there is a well-established, much more legally durable mechanism for most of the tariffs on China that make them less affected than those on other countries,” Chorzempa said.
> The Ministry of External Affairs clarified that the UN joint statement condemning Israel's West Bank expansion was not a negotiated document and does not represent India's official stance. India's position was outlined in the India-Arab League Ministerial meeting, supporting a sovereign Palestine coexisting with Israel. India was among over 100 countries endorsing the statement, which condemned Israel's actions in the West Bank as violations of international law.

### 3. [Trump Tariffs Highlights: India-US trade framework may need review after 10% US levy, say experts](https://www.cnbctv18.com/world/us-supreme-court-tariffs-ruling-live-updates-president-donald-trump-us-stock-markets-sp500-dow-jones-nasdaq-liveblog-ws-l-19854912.htm)

> “We have noted the US Supreme Court judgment on tariffs delivered yesterday. President Trump has also addressed a press conference in that regard, and certain steps have been announced by the US Administration. We are studying all these developments and assessing their implications.”
> On the US Supreme Court’s order on the US tariffs, Congress MP Pramod Tiwari said to ANI, “I respect the US Supreme Court’s decision and want to say that the tariffs imposed were wrong. The US President had no authority… I demand that the US repeal them… He (Donald Trump) also said that the tariffs would benefit the US… Congress opposes them. We oppose the way the interests of farmers and small businesses have been placed in the US Treasury.”
> On the US Supreme Court’s order on US tariffs, Congress MP Manish Tewari said to ANI that the 6-3 verdict is a message to constitutional courts around the world that they are responsible for checking executive excess.
> He added, “The decision of the US Supreme Court is a welcome decision. However, it also sets the stage for an unprecedented confrontation between the Trump administration and the judiciary on the one hand, with the legislature on the other hand. Because the US Supreme Court has clearly said that the power to levy tariffs does not rest in the executive, it rests with the legislature.”
> He stated, “Now it’s for the US Congress to assert itself, exert itself and appropriate the authority that is legitimately according to the US constitutional scheme.”
> T V Narendran, CEO and Managing Director of Tata Steel Ltd, said that while steel is not directly impacted by the 10% US tariff, exports to the US—such as auto components—could feel the effect. “There is no negative impact; in some sense it’s structured on what was being expected,” he noted, adding that he is also watching developments in Europe, where EU steel exports to the US had faced 50% tariffs. Narendran emphasised the ongoing uncertainty: “It is very difficult for supply chains to keep adjusting and readjusting on a short-term basis. If you ship something today, it will take a month or two to reach the US. We are not going to overreact to the announcements, we will wait and see. What is sure is the uncertainty.” He added that President Trump has indicated he may use other measures to bring back tariffs, making supply chain planning particularly challenging for manufacturers.
> Nikhil Sawhney, Vice Chairman and Managing Director of Triveni Turbine Limited, said that while the 10% US tariff provides a framework, it brings additional uncertainties for Indian manufacturers. “What is quite certain is there is more uncertainty around tariffs,” he noted. He added that the 150-day period is insufficient for planning manufacturing and supply chains. “For Indian manufacturing, it does present another set of uncertainties. The issue is how do you transfer price between Indian and US operations,” Sawhney said, emphasizing the importance of the US market, a $30 trillion economy, for India to preserve and grow its market share.
> Sanjay Kirloskar, Chairman and Managing Director of Kirloskar Brothers Ltd, welcomed the move, calling it a positive step that could improve global trade. “There was a lot of disruption, volatility earlier; hopefully things will be stable,” he said.
> Vishal Kampani, Vice Chairman and Managing Director of JM Financial Ltd, said that while the 10% US tariffs are temporary and set for only 150 days, it is too early to predict their full impact. “Trump and the administration will try and find ways to come around the 10% tariff,” he said, adding that markets should be prepared for volatility and uncertainty.
> Kanwal Sibal – former Foreign Secretary of India; reaction: “This poses a big diplomatic challenge for India” – commenting on the broader diplomatic implications of the US tariff move.
> Jayant Das Gupta – former trade negotiator; reactions: “US-India deal will need to be reviewed thoroughly” and “India should not agree to an 18% tariff now, it’s illogical” – highlighting trade strategy and tariff logic.
> Abhijit Das, international trade expert and former head of the Centre for WTO Studies says India may need to revisit the concessions it has offered in its ongoing trade negotiations with the United States after Washington announced a fresh 10% tariff on imports. He said the development calls for a more coordinated response from countries that are similarly affected by the move.
> “Our negotiators should recalibrate the concessions we have offered,” Das told CNBC-TV18, adding that India should reach out to countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia and Argentina to evolve a common position on the new 10% tariff.
> Former commerce secretary Anup Wadhawan says the India -US trade agreement will need to be revised, after White House officials clarified that there will be a fresh 10% levy on all nations from Feb 24, which effectively brings down US tariffs on India to 10% from 18%.
> “India-US trade deal framework needs to be revised… Hope better sense will prevail from the US side as well,” he told CNBC-TV18.
> Indian government sources told CNBC-TV18 that the US tariff on Indian goods will be reduced to 10% following the latest notification from the White House.
> All goods that were earlier subject to a 25% reciprocal tariff will now see the rate drop to 10%.
> An earlier proposed cut to 18% had not yet been notified, which means the applicable tariff will now move directly from 25% to 10%.
> White House officials have clarified to CNBC that countries with trade agreements with the United States, including India, will see tariff rates lowered to 10% under the latest proclamation signed by US President Donald Trump.
> According to officials, the revised ad valorem tariff rate of 10% will apply for a period of 150 days, as outlined in the proclamation issued earlier this week. The temporary duty is set to take effect from February 24 at 12:01 a.m. Eastern Standard Time.
> The S&P 500 climbed 0.69%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.9%, and the Dow Jones rose 230.81 points, rebounding from an early 200-point loss triggered by weak economic data. Tech and consumer-focused stocks led the upside after the Supreme Court struck down Trump-era tariffs. Amazon, which sources a large share of its products from China, jumped 2%, benefiting from the removal of import duty pressures that had threatened higher prices for customers. Other retailers like Home Depot and Five Below also moved higher.
> Thanks for watching CNBC TV18’s live updates on the Supreme Court striking down Trump’s tariffs. Stay tuned for more market reactions and analysis as the story develops.
> The US government may owe over $175 billion in refunds to importers following the Supreme Court’s 6-3 ruling that President Trump’s tariffs, imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), were illegal. The tariffs, unilaterally levied without congressional approval, have been in place for years, and multiple companies already have pending lawsuits seeking refunds.
> Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, dissenting, warned the refund process would be “messy,” as importers may have already passed costs to consumers, and billions in collected tariffs could need to be returned. The tariffs, which previously supported trade deals with China, the UK, Japan, and other nations, now face uncertainty.
> Economists, including Brian LeBlanc of PNC, estimate the illegal IEEPA tariffs accounted for roughly 60% of all US tariffs to date, dropping the effective tariff rate from about 9.5% to 5%. While refunds will be complex, the Trump administration is expected to replace most lost tariff revenue using alternative legal authorities.
> Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent clarified that the Supreme Court ruling did not invalidate President Donald Trump’s tariffs, but only restricted the use of IEEPA authority to raise revenue. Speaking at the Economic Club of Dallas on Friday, Bessent said six justices ruled that IEEPA could not be used to generate even a single dollar, leaving the core tariff policy intact.
> He added that the administration plans to invoke alternative legal authorities to maintain tariff enforcement, including Section 122, with potential enhancements to Section 232 and Section 301 measures. According to Treasury estimates, this approach would result in virtually unchanged tariff revenue in 2026, ensuring continuity of the trade strategy.
> Bessent’s comments signal that despite the Supreme Court’s technical limitation, the administration can continue its broader trade agenda with China and other partners, maintaining economic leverage while staying within legal frameworks. Markets and businesses are now assessing the implications for imports, tariffs, and related supply chains.
> US President Donald Trump will travel to China from March 31 to April 2 for talks with President Xi Jinping, in his first visit to Beijing since 2017.
> A central issue had been whether to extend a tariff truce that prevented further escalation between the two economies. After the Supreme Court ruling, it remains unclear whether Trump can restore tariffs on Chinese imports and under what authority. The administration has defended the tariffs on national security grounds, citing trade imbalances and China’s alleged role in producing fentanyl-related chemicals.
> The leaders last met in October in South Korea, where Trump agreed to trim tariffs in exchange for increased Chinese soybean purchases and continued rare earth exports.
> The S&P 500 surged to near the day’s high after the US President decided to reverse the Supreme Court’s decision to strike down the tariffs imposed on America’s trading partners.The yield on the benchmark 10-year bonds fell as much 10 basis points after moving close to 5% after the SC decision earlier. The yield fell to 4.09% as of 12:33 am (IST) on Feb 21, after rising as high as 4.107% earlier in the day. The S&P 500 moved up 0.6%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 139 points, or 0.3%, recovering from a 200-point loss earlier in the session on disappointing economic data.
> Donald Trump said the India-US trade agreement will remain unchanged even as he sharply criticised the US Supreme Court for limiting his use of emergency tariff powers. He signalled that trade deals that do not hold up will be replaced with new tariffs, raising the prospect of another round of global trade tensions.
> “Some of the trade deals stand, ones which don’t will be replaced by new tariffs,” Trump said, adding twice that “nothing changes on the trade agreement with India.” He also described a “little flip” in trade terms, claiming the US is no longer paying tariffs to India while India is paying tariffs to the US. However, he added, “My relationship with India is fantastic.”

> President Donald Trump said Friday he expects the Supreme Court’s decision invalidating his tariffs to prompt an extensive legal fight over whether his administration now has to pay companies billions of dollars in refunds. “Wouldn’t you think they would have put one sentence in there saying, keep the money or don’t keep the money, right?” Trump said during a press briefing. “It’s not discussed. We’ll end up being in court for the next five years.”

> — The White House (@WhiteHouse) February 20, 2026
> President Donald Trump said he’s ashamed of the Supreme Court justices — some of whom he appointed — who ruled against his tariffs. “The Supreme Court’s ruling on tariffs is deeply disappointing, and I’m ashamed of certain members of the court, absolutely ashamed for not having the courage to do what’s right for our country,” Trump said in the White House briefing room on Friday. “They’re against anything that makes America strong, healthy and great again. They also are a frankly disgrace to our nation those justices,” he added. “I’d like to thank and congratulate justices Thomas Alito and Kavanaugh for their strength and wisdom and love of our country,” Trump said. “When you read the dissenting opinions, there is no way that anyone can argue against them.”
> President Donald Trump said Friday he’s immediately going to enact a 10% global tariff under a trade law known as Section 122 following the Supreme Court’s landmark ruling earlier in the day. But unlike the prior tariffs Trump imposed, the new levies can only be in place for a maximum of 150 days, barring congressional approval for an extension, according to a CNN report.
> Trump also told reporters he will be initiating several new investigations that are necessary precursors to imposing tariffs under a separate trade law known as Section 301.
> President Donald Trump says there are alternative methods to apply tariffs that could potentially generate more revenue than the emergency powers now off limits.
> “Other alternatives will now be used to replace the ones that the court incorrectly rejected. We have alternatives,” he told reporters at the White House.
> He said the new avenues had been “approved by the decision” the court handed down today.
> In a sweeping escalation of his protectionist trade agenda, US President Donald Trump will sign an executive order imposing a 10% global tariff on imports, effective immediately, over and above the existing tariff structure, he announced in his White House press briefing responding to the Supreme Court ruling on emergency tariffs. The new levy will be enforced under Section 122, while the current national security tariffs imposed under Sections 301 and 232 will remain fully in place and continue in “full force and effect”. This effectively creates a layered tariff regime, significantly raising the overall duty burden on goods entering the United States across sectors and geographies.
> Trump further said that broader executive powers remain available beyond those granted under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. He claimed that tariff measures used over the past year have been effective in advancing national economic and security objectives.

> The Supreme Court struck down one of President Donald Trump's most frequently used trade tools on Friday, and his backup plan could face roadblocks on Capitol Hill.
> Trump wasted no time announcing a 10% global tariff after the high court found that the president illegally used an emergency powers law to impose sweeping import taxes without approval from Congress.
> The 6-3 ruling struck down his so-called reciprocal tariffs,  announced on virtually all U.S. trading partners last year, plus levies on China, Mexico, and Canada that relied on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA. Tariffs imposed through other legal authorities remain in place, including sector-specific tariffs on steel, aluminum, copper, cars and kitchen cabinets.
> Trump condemned the ruling but vowed to use other strategies to keep his trade agenda intact.
> "It's a little more complicated. The process takes a little more time, but the result is going to get us more money, and I think it's going to be great," Trump said.
> Trump quickly signed an executive action to impose a 10% tax on imports from around the world, "over and above our normal TARIFFS already being charged." The levies will rely on a law called Section 122, which limits the duration of tariffs to 150 days unless lawmakers pass an extension.
> House Speaker Mike Johnson said Friday that Congress and the Trump administration will determine the best path forward in the coming weeks.
> "No one can deny that the President’s use of tariffs has brought in billions of dollars and created immense leverage for America’s trade strategy and for securing strong, reciprocal America-first trade agreements with countries that had been taking advantage of American workers for decades," Johnson said.
> A tariff vote could be politically tricky for Republicans ahead of the midterm elections this fall, largely focused on affordability. In an AP-NORC poll conducted after the president announced worldwide tariffs last April, 76% of Americans said the policies would increase the cost of consumer goods.
> Those tensions were laid bare earlier this month when six House Republicans joined Democrats to vote for a resolution against Trump’s tariffs on Canada.
> "The conservative position here is that tariffs are bad economics, bad politics, and we should defend that," Rep. Don Bacon, a Republican from Nebraska, told CNN after the ruling. "Many Republicans opposed tariffs. They don’t wanna go against the president's signature economic plan, though they themselves don’t think it’s wise."
> Some other Republicans joined Democrats in celebrating the Supreme Court's ruling on Friday.
> Senator Mitch McConnell, who previously led the Republican caucus, said in a statement, “Congress’ role in trade policy, as I have warned repeatedly, is not an inconvenience to avoid. If the executive would like to enact trade policies that impact American producers and consumers, its path forward is crystal clear: convince their representatives under Article 1."
> Asked on Friday if he plans to ask Congress to take additional action on tariffs, Trump said, "I don't need to. It's already been approved. I mean, I would ask Congress and probably get it."
> Alongside the 10% global tariff announced on Friday, Trump said that his administration is also initiating several national security investigations, which could pave the way for additional tariffs.
> Meanwhile, some lawmakers and business groups are calling on the Trump administration to refund businesses for previously paid tariffs.
> Two Democrats, Congressman Steven Horsford of Nevada and Congresswoman Janelle Bynum of Oregon, introduced legislation that would require automatic refunds to small and independent businesses within 90 days of enactment. If passed, it would apply to covered tariffs collected since January 1, 2025.
> The Supreme Court's ruling didn't address whether and how the government should go about returning the billions it collected from importers.  In his dissent, Justice Brett Kavanaugh said the process "is likely to be a 'mess.'"
> Indeed, many companies have already lined up in court to demand refunds. Trump predicted it would take years of litigation to resolve the issue.

### 5. [India joins US-led initiative to build secure technology supply chains](https://www.columbian.com/news/2026/feb/21/india-joins-us-led-initiative-to-build-secure-technology-supply-chains/)
**Source**: The Columbian | **Date**: 2026-02-21T18:15:00+00:00

> NEW DELHI — India joined a U.S.-led initiative to strengthen technology cooperation among strategic allies in a move Friday that underscores the nations’ warming ties after a brief strain over New Delhi’s unabated purchase of discounted Russian oil.
> The decision aligns India closely with Washington’s efforts to build secure supply chains for semiconductors, advanced manufacturing and critical technologies at a time geopolitical competition with China is intensifying. It also signals a reset in relations following friction over energy trade and tariffs.
> Nations that have joined the Pax Silica framework include Japan, South Korea, the U.K. and Israel.
> “Pax Silica will be a group of nations that believe technology should empower free people and free markets. India’s entry into Pax Silica isn’t just symbolic. Its strategic, its essential,” U.S. Ambassador Sergio Gor said in a speech preceding the agreement signing.
> Pax Silica is aimed at strengthening cooperation among partner countries on semiconductor design, fabrication, research and supply chain resilience. The initiative seeks to reduce dependence on China-dominated manufacturing hubs while promoting trusted production networks across democracies and strategic allies.
> The development at the artificial intelligence summit in New Delhi comes weeks after India and the U.S. reached an interim trade framework to reduce tariffs and grant greater access to each other’s markets, easing tensions that had threatened to slow bilateral momentum.
> President Donald Trump announced earlier this month that the U.S. would lower reciprocal import tariffs on India from 25% to 18% and also remove the additional 25% levy imposed earlier for buying Russian crude after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi agreed to stop it.
> India had ramped up Russian oil imports after Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, drawing criticism from western partners even as New Delhi defended the purchases as necessary to manage inflation and protect its consumers.
> India’s entry into Pax Silica, combined with trade concessions, marks a strategic convergence that extends beyond commerce into long-term technology and security cooperation, reinforcing India’s role as a key U.S. partner in the Indo-Pacific.
> “From the trade deal to Pax Silica to defense cooperation, the potential for our two nations to work together is truly limitless,” Gor said.

**Source**: The Telegraph | **Date**: 2026-02-20T23:09:00+00:00

> Donald Trump has imposed 10pc tariffs on ‌imports from ⁠all countries, despite a landmark Supreme Court ruling striking down much of his taxes on imports.
> The US president said on Friday he has signed documents to impose the fresh duties, which will ⁠be “effective almost immediately”.
> “It is my Great Honor to have just signed, from the Oval Office, a Global 10% Tariff on all Countries, which will be effective almost immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter!” He wrote on his Truth Social platform.
> Mr Trump’s defiant move comes hours after the country’s highest court opposed the “reciprocal” levies he implemented last year.
> The US president said he was “absolutely ashamed” of the six judges who backed the decision and called them a “disgrace to our nation”.
> “They’re just being fools and lapdogs for the Rinos [Republicans in name only] and the radical-Left Democrats,” he said.
> “It’s my opinion that the court has been swayed by foreign interests and a political movement that is far smaller than people would ever think.”
> He congratulated the three justices who dissented and said there was “no way anyone can argue against” their opinions. One of those justices warned that the prospect of refunds worth billions of dollars would have “significant consequences for the US treasury”.
> Mr Trump said the ruling would have foreign countries that had been “ripping off” America “dancing in the streets – but they won’t be dancing for long”.
> The president claimed the court ruling actually gave him more power to impose tariffs on America’s trading partners and said he could use various other legal channels to “charge much more than I was charging”.
> The Supreme Court ruled on Friday that the president had no authority to impose tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).
> IEEPA was the legal justification for the sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs that Mr Trump announced on April 2 last year, as well as for the “fentanyl” tariffs he imposed on China and Mexico.
> In a press conference hours after the judgment, Mr Trump vowed to reimpose 10pc tariffs on all countries under a separate piece of legislation, the Trade Act of 1974.
> Section 122 of the act allows the president to apply tariffs of up to 15pc on imports for 150 days to deal with deficits. It can be extended with congressional approval. Mr Trump said the new tariffs would start three days from now.
> The US president said he would also initiate country-specific tariffs under section 301 of the same act, which allows the US to retaliate if an investigation finds a trading partner has engaged in unreasonable behaviour.
> Mr Trump said: “Now I’ll go the way I could have gone originally, which is even stronger than our original choice.”
> US trade officials used such investigations as the basis for many of the tariffs imposed on Chinese goods during Mr Trump’s first presidency.
> The 10pc tariff announced on Friday will boost many nations that previously had higher levies in place, such as the European Union, which had a 15pc rate, and India, which faced an 18pc charge on exports to America.
> The UK, which had a 10pc baseline levy under the “reciprocal” regime, will technically see no change. However, there is a risk that it could lose some of its competitive trading edge as other countries’ tariff barriers fall.
> IEEPA levies made up around 60pc of the US Treasury’s tariff revenue – some $175bn to date – and the Supreme Court ruling threatens to blow a significant hole in US public finances.
> The Tax Foundation had expected IEEPA tariff revenues to total $1.4tn between 2026 and 2034.
> US government borrowing costs rose slightly on Friday while the dollar dipped, falling by 0.17pc against a basket of major currencies.
> US stocks rose on hopes that businesses would now be able to claim back some of the tariffs they paid under the struck-down regime. The S&P 500 climbed by 0.6pc while the tech-heavy Nasdaq was up 0.9pc.
> Businesses are gearing up to reclaim the $175bn but Mr Trump suggested that they will face a years-long legal battle to get their cash back.
> The Supreme Court did not include any judgment on whether the administration had to give refunds. Mr Trump said: “I guess it has to get litigated… it’s not discussed, we’ll end up being in court for the next five years.”
> The ruling struck a further blow to the US economy, which suffered a shock slowdown at the end of last year, according to official figures released on Friday.
> GDP growth slowed to just 1.4pc in the last three months of 2025, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), down from 4.4pc in the previous quarter.
> This was far less than the 2.8pc economists had been expecting.
> Growth slowed to 2.2pc overall across 2025, the first year of Donald Trump’s second term, down from 2.8pc in 2024, Biden’s last year as president. It marked the slowest annual growth rate since 2022.
> That’s all we have for today. Thanks for joining us.
> The Supreme Court ruled that Donald Trump’s tariffs on trading partners were unlawful.
> The President said he was “deeply” disappointed by the decision and that he would sign an executive order immediately to impose a 10pc global tariff on foreign countries under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, which allows him to apply blanket levies for up to five months.
> US markets advanced in response to the news, signalling that investors may feel American companies could face slightly less pressure.
> US markets have risen after the Supreme Court ruled Donald Trump’s tariffs were unlawful.
> The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.9pc, while the S&P 500 edged 0.7pc higher after the news that American companies could face less pressure following the decision on levies.
> The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.3pc.
> Experts suggested that the somewhat muted reaction from Wall Street indicated expectations from traders of the ruling.
> Donald Trump said that Iran “better negotiate a fair deal”.
> “I feel very badly for the people of Iran,” he said.
> It comes after the US president said on Thursday the world would “find out” if Washington and Tehran were able to make a deal within the next 10 days, adding that “bad things” would happen if the Islamic Republic did not agree to one.
> Mr Trump said his administration will be in court “for the next five years” over paying tariff refunds to businesses.
> Mr Trump suggested the companies seeking refunds would face major delays because the Supreme Court did not include any guidance on whether the administration had to return any money already paid in levies.
> He said: “I guess it has to get litigated … it’s not discussed, we’ll end up being in court for the next five years.”
> Countries have so far paid around $175bn (£130bn) in tariffs to the US.
> Donald Trump has claimed that he now has “more power” to impose tariffs on America’s trading partners.
> The US president said: “While I am sure that they did not mean to do so, the Supreme Court’s decision today made a president’s ability to both regulate trade and impose tariffs more powerful and more crystal clear, rather than less.”
> “The Supreme Court did not overrule tariffs, they merely overruled a particular use of IEEPA.”
> Mr Trump said he could now turn to a fleet of other legal routes to raise tariffs and restrict trade and claimed that he “can charge much more than I was charging”.
> All countries will have to pay 10pc tariffs on goods exports to the US as Mr Trump announced a new wave of levies in retaliation to the Supreme Court ruling.
> The president said he will sign an executive order today to impose a 10pc global tariff under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, which allows him to apply blanket tariffs for up to five months.
> Mr Trump said: “Today, I will sign an order to impose a 10pc global tariff under Section 122, over and above our normal tariffs already being charged. And we’re also initiating several section 301, and other investigations to protect our country from unfair trading practices of other countries.”
> Donald Trump has suggested he will soon announce alternative tariff measures to replace the IEEPA levies that have been overruled.
> Speaking at a White House press briefing, the US president said: “The good news is that there are methods, practices, statutes and authorities, as recognised by the entire court in this terrible decision, and also is recognised by Congress, which they refer to, that are even stronger than the IEEPA tariffs available to me as President of the United States.”
> Donald Trump has called the Supreme Court ruling “deeply disappointing”. The president said he was “ashamed” at some members of the Court, without naming them.
> Mr Trump added: “They’re just being fools and lap dogs for the rhinos and the radical left Democrats.
> “It’s my opinion that the court has been swayed by foreign interests and a political movement that is far smaller than people would ever think.”
> He said foreign countries that had been “ripping off” America had been “dancing in the streets but they won’t be dancing for long”.
> He congratulated the three justices who dissented and said there is “no way anyone can argue against” their opinions.
> Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker of the House of Representatives, called Donald Trump’s tariffs “reckless” and “unconstitutional” in a post on X.
> “Today, the Supreme Court rightfully struck them down, upholding the Constitution and rejecting an abuse of executive power that unlawfully taxed millions of Americans,” she said.
> Trump's sweeping tariffs were reckless, unconstitutional and costly for America's working families.Today, the Supreme Court rightfully struck them down, upholding the Constitution and rejecting an abuse of executive power that unlawfully taxed millions of Americans.The Court…
> Business investment in the US will get hit as Donald Trump scrambles to find new ways to raise tariffs to get around the Supreme Court ruling, JP Morgan has warned.
> America’s trading partners may get caught in the crossfire if the White House manages to maintain its level of tariff income by using other levers to impose the levies, the bank’s chief US economist Michael Feroli added in a client note.
> Mr Feroli said: “Even this outcome would entail a significant realignment of tariffs placed on different products from different countries, thereby creating winners and losers.
> “This would also mean a material increase in trade policy uncertainty, creating a new headwind to capex. While the US economy clearly performed better than feared after liberation day, non-tech capex contracted last year, a very rare occurrence outside of a recession.”
> The Supreme Court ruling will cost Donald Trump $1.4tn (£1.04tn) in lost tariff revenues in nine years, new analysis shows.
> This is the amount of money that would have been raised by tariffs imposed using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) from 2026-2034, according to the Tax Foundation.
> However, the White House is expected to quickly announce new measures to raise tariffs through other means and plug the gap.
> US government borrowing costs could rise further as the Supreme Court ruling brings new pressure on the fiscal deficit, ING has warned.
> Chris Turner, global head of markets at the bank, said that the biggest threat from the tariff ruling is its impact on the US deficit because it wipes out a source of government income.
> Mr Turner said: “The biggest direct impact is on the fiscal deficit, and, by extension, on bond supply. There is no doubt that tariff tax revenue has acted as something of a comfort blanket for deficit concerns.
> “It’s tough to argue that there is a growth spurt to come from this whole mess. To get there, we’d need to see a material ratchet down in the tariff intention being shown by the administration. Ultimately, this translates into a path for the 10-year yield towards 4.25pc.”
> Currently, rates on 10-year US government bonds are 4.09pc.
> UK businesses face a new wave of uncertainty as the Supreme Court ruling throws US import policy into doubt, a trade body has warned.
> Duncan Edwards, chief executive of BritishAmerican Business, which represents nearly 500 companies on either side of the Atlantic, said: “Today’s Supreme Court ruling adds to the continuing uncertainty for business around US trade policy. While it provides clarity on the legal question, it leaves open issues around how tariffs will now be handled and indeed whether they might even increase.
> “Businesses on both sides of the Atlantic need stability and predictability and prolonged ambiguity is disruptive.
> “It is essential that this ruling does not undermine the positive momentum in the US-UK economic relationship. We encourage policymakers to maintain a constructive dialogue and to prioritise tariff reduction as part of a forward-looking transatlantic trade agenda.”
> The value of the US dollar has dropped in response to the Supreme Court tariff ruling.
> The greenback fell by 0.15pc against a basket of currencies on Friday following the court’s decision to invalidate the tariffs Donald Trump imposed using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).
> Matthew Ryan, of financial services firm Ebury, said the fall reflects “heightened fiscal concerns” as investors worry over the future of the US public finances.
> “Markets fret that the massive tariff refunds could create a significant US budget shortfall, a higher deficit and an increase in debt issuance.”
> Donald Trump is speaking at a press conference at 5.45pm London time after his tariffs were struck down by the Supreme Court, the White House press secretary has said.
> 🚨President Trump will hold a press briefing on the Supreme Court's tariff decision at 12:45PM ET
> The Supreme Court ruling blows a hole in Donald Trump’s economic agenda and threatens the trade deals he has agreed with America’s partners such as the UK.
> Andrew Hale, fellow at Advancing American Freedom (AAF) said: “Those Liberation Day tariffs all evaporate.
> “This was the threat and the instrument used to beat our allies over the head and get them to submit to unfair terms in these so-called trade deals. And now that instrument is not there.
> “If a country has a tariff, the importers don’t have to pay those tariffs anymore. They just evaporate. They’re gone. The Customs and Border Protection can’t legally collect those tariffs. And now you’re gonna have an army of lawsuits coming forth as people want their tariff money back.”
> Morgan Stanley said it is currently unclear whether tariff payments would have to be refunded.
> Economists at the bank wrote in a note: “The Court did not dictate whether the Trump administration has to repay the tariffs or do so over any specific timeframe.
> “That said, tariff collection likely stops immediately; given that the Supreme Court struck down the IEEPA tariff authority broadly, continued  collections would lack legal basis.
> “As we anticipated, this will likely result in prolonged uncertainty as the question of refunds will  be left to the deliberations of the lower courts.
> “In the past, refunds were initially limited only to companies that proactively filed complaints or litigation through a process established by CBP or the Treasury, which may ultimately limit the scope of refunds.”
> Dominic LeBlanc, the minister for Canada-US trade, said the Supreme Court ruling “reinforces” that the tariffs imposed on trading partners are “unjustified”.
> He wrote in a post on X that “critical work lies ahead to support Canadian businesses and workers who remain affected by Section 232 tariffs on steel, aluminum and automotive sectors.”
> The United States Supreme Court's decision reinforces Canada's position that the IEEPA tariffs imposed by the United States are unjustified.While Canada has the best trade deal with the United States of any trading partner, we recognize that critical work lies ahead to support…
> Stocks have pushed higher after the US Supreme Court overturned most of Donald Trump’s tariffs, which could boost company earnings around the globe.
> The Nasdaq Composite was up 1.1pc and the S&P 500 gained 0.6pc as Wall Street overcame early losses caused by official figures showing weaker-than-expected growth in the US economy.
> The FTSE 100 ended the day up 0.6pc and the Cac 40 in Paris closed up 1.4pc amid the prospect that damaging tariffs could be wiped out.
> The International Chamber of Commerce secretary general John Denton said: “Many businesses will welcome the prospect of refunds following today’s ruling, given the significant strain that the IEEPA tariffs have placed on corporate balance sheets in recent months.
> “But companies should not expect a simple process: the structure of U.S. import procedures means claims are likely to be administratively complex.
> “Today’s ruling is worrylying silent on this issue and clear guidance from the Court of International Trade and the relevant US authorities will be essential to minimise avoidable costs and prevent litigation risks.”
> Donald Trump was speaking to a room full of US governors at the White House when he was handed a note from an aide informing him of the Supreme Court decision, according to Reuters.
> The US president was reportedly visibly frustrated and told the crowd that he had to do something about the courts.
> As he relayed the news to the governors, he called the ruling “a disgrace”.
> The leader of the Democrats in the House of Representatives called the Supreme Court ruling a “big victory for the American people”.
> Brooklyn Congressman Hakeem Jeffries said it was “another crushing defeat for the wannabe King”.
> The Supreme Court decision striking down the harmful Trump Tariffs is a big victory for the American people. And another crushing defeat for the wannabe King.
> Mike Pence has called the Supreme Court ruling a “victory” for American people.
> Donald Trump’s former vice-president during his first term wrote in a post on X that the decision reaffirms “the Constitution grants Congress - not the President - the power to tax”.
> Today's 6-3 ruling by the Supreme Court is a Victory for the American People and a Win for the Separation of Powers enshrined in the Constitution of the United States. In Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump, our Supreme Court has reaffirmed that the Constitution grants Congress -…
> The cost of US government borrowing rose after the Supreme Court ruled against President Trump’s tariff campaign.
> The yield on US bonds rose as the ruling raised the prospect of a sharp jump in government spending to potentially cover refunds to companies forced to pay the levies.
> The yield on 10-year treasury bonds, a benchmark for borrowing costs around the world, rose by two basis points to 4.09pc.
> George Lagarias, chief economist at Forvis Mazars, said the Supreme Court’s decision “throws the US government’s aggressive geoeconomic strategy in disarray”.
> He said: “The ruling casts a shadow on the US budget, as full refunds could add more than half a percentage point to the deficit.
> “Having said that, we have long maintained that this will simply prompt the US government to shift gears, from country tariffs to product tariffs, where the President has considerably more leeway to impose without Congressional approval.”
> He added: “It’s probably good news for consumers and importer companies (who stand to benefit from possible refunds) and bad news for American long term debt, as more bond issuance could be required to cover possible budget shortfalls.”
> The US Chamber of Commerce said the Supreme Court’s ruling is “welcome news” and that refunds would be “meaningful” for small businesses.The largest lobbying group in America said: “Over the past year, the Chamber has been working with small and midsize businesses around the country that have seen significant cost increases and supply chain disruptions as a result of these tariffs. “Swift refunds of the impermissible tariffs will be meaningful for the more than 200,000 small business importers in this country and will help support stronger economic growth this year.”We encourage the administration to use this opportunity to reset overall tariff policy in a manner that will lead to greater economic growth, larger wage gains for workers, and lower costs for families.”
> Oxford Economics have warned that despite the Supreme Court ruling, Donald Trump’s tariffs may still settle close to their current levels.
> Michael Pearce, chief US economist at the group, wrote that the decision lowers the current tariff rate from 12.8pc to 8.3pc.
> However, he said: “Any boost to the economy from lowering tariffs in the near-term is likely to be partly offset by a prolonged period of uncertainty, and with the administration likely to rebuild tariffs through other, more durable, means, the overall tariffs rate may yet end up settling close to current levels.
> “The administration has frequently highlighted other powers it could use to rebuild much of the tariff regime struck down by this decision.
> “The White House may turn to Section 122 to immediately implement an up to 15pc tariff on all US imports for as many as 150 days before requiring Congressional approval for an extension.
> “That could serve as a bridge while the administration pursues other trade authorities, which require investigations but are more legally durable.”
> UK law firm Simmons & Simmons have warned that a new world order is “unfolding” and businesses need to adapt.
> Basil Woodd-Walker, of the law firm, wrote in a note that Donald Trump has made it clear he “is not going to abandon his international trade policy, and will find other ways to implement it.”
> He said: “The US Administration may pivot to other tariff regimes or trade barriers to replace the lost income from the IEEPA tariffs.
> “The lesson for UK and European businesses is clear: a new world order is unfolding, with high levels of uncertainty about the future direction of U.S. trade policy and the international rule of law.
> “It underscores the need continuously to test and adapt business models to those shifts, diversifying supply chains and onshoring where possible.”
> The National Retail Federation is demanding a “seamless process” to refund tariffs to US importers.
> The world’s largest retail federation said: “The Supreme Court’s announcement today regarding tariffs provides much-needed certainty for US businesses and manufacturers, enabling global supply chains to operate without ambiguity.”
> “We urge the lower court to ensure a seamless process to refund the tariffs to US importers,” it added. “The refunds will serve as an economic boost and allow companies to reinvest in their operations, their employees and their customers.”
> Speaking to reporters in Scotland, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said she was “thrilled” by the Supreme Court decision.
> She said: “Tariffs are expensive for both sides.
> “The consumer in the US pays more, as does the supplier in the UK or in other countries, so I hope that this holds.”
> Donald Trump relied on emergency powers to impose his tariffs without Congress’s approval.
> He declared the flow of drugs and migrants from Canada to be a national emergency, then said the same about the US’s trade deficit with the rest of the world, using the claims to justify cranking taxes on imports up and down on his say so.
> Now America’s Supreme Court has ruled he overreached his authority.
> Donald Trump has reportedly called the Supreme Court’s tariff ruling “a disgrace” and told governors at a breakfast meeting in the White House that he has a back-up plan.
> News: President Trump commented on the Supreme Court ruling striking down his tariffs while inside the White House breakfast with governors this morning, calling it a "disgrace," I'm told. He told those gathered that he has a backup plan.
> The dollar has weakened after the Supreme Court ruled against Donald Trump’s tariffs and raised questions about a potential wave of refunds claims against the US government.
> The US currency was down 0.3pc against the pound, which tipped over $1.35, and was down 0.2pc versus the euro, which was near $1.18.
> Rob Burdett of Nedgroup Investments said the ruling has major implications across stocks, bonds, currencies and global trade flows.
> He said: “The US dollar may soften if tariff refunds increase the deficit and reduce the policy‑tightening impulse from higher import prices. Elsewhere, lower input costs ease pressure on margins, especially for retailers and manufacturers.”
> We Pay the Tariffs, a coalition of 800 American small businesses, have called the Supreme Court’s decision to strike down tariffs a “tremendous victory”.The group that opposes Donald Trump’s levies called on the White House and Congress to deliver “full, fast and automatic” tariff refunds. Dan Anthony, executive director of the group, said: “Today’s Supreme Court decision is a tremendous victory for America’s small businesses who have been bearing the crushing weight of these tariffs. “Our coalition members, who through hard work, late nights, and sweat equity built local businesses, have paid billions in tariffs that never should have been imposed.“The administration’s only responsible course of action now is to establish a fast, efficient, and automatic refund process that returns tariff money to the businesses that paid it. “Small businesses cannot afford to wait months or years while bureaucratic delays play out, nor can they afford expensive litigation just to recover money that was unlawfully collected from them in the first place.”
> The UK Government expects its “privileged trading position with the US to continue”, after the Supreme Court in Washington overturned Donald Trump’s tariffs agenda.
> A Government spokesperson said: “This is a matter for the US to determine but we will continue to support UK businesses as further details are announced.
> “The UK enjoys the lowest reciprocal tariffs globally, and under any scenario we expect our privileged trading position with the US to continue.
> “We will work with the Administration to understand how the ruling will affect tariffs for the UK and the rest of the world.”
> One of Britain’s biggest business lobbying groups said the tariff ruling “does little to clear the murky waters” for companies.
> William Bain of the British Chambers of Commerce said: “Different legislation has been used for other US tariffs, such as for steel and aluminium, and the President also has other options at his disposal to retain his current regime.
> “Indeed, if he wants to, he could use the 1974 Trade Act to impose even higher tariffs than the additional 10pc levies that the UK and Australia have already been affected by in many goods sectors.
> “The court’s decision also raises questions on how US importers can reclaim levies already paid and whether UK exporters can also receive a share of any rebate depending on commercial trading terms.
> “For the UK, the priority remains bringing tariffs down wherever possible. It’s important the UK government continues to negotiate on issues like steel and aluminium tariffs and reduces the scope of other possible duties.
> “We have recently agreed a good deal on pharmaceuticals, and we should focus on using the Economic Prosperity Deal to ensure the UK gets the preferential treatment outlined there.
> “Any competitive advantage that we can secure is likely to help boost our exports to the single country, globally, we do most trade with.”
> The EU said it is seeking “clarity” following the Supreme Court’s ruling on Donald Trump’s tariffs.
> Olof Gill, the European Commission’s deputy chief spokesman, said: “We take note of the ruling by the US Supreme Court and are analysing it carefully.
> “We remain in close contact with the U.S. Administration as we seek clarity on the steps they intend to take in response to this ruling.
> “Businesses on both sides of the Atlantic depend on stability and predictability in the trading relationship. We therefore continue to advocate for low tariffs and to work towards reducing them.”

> In its decision, the Supreme Court said the US Constitution gave “Congress alone” the power to impose tariffs during peacetime.
> It added: “And the foreign affairs implications of tariffs do not make it any more likely that Congress would relinquish its tariff power through vague language, or without careful limits.
> “Accordingly, the President must ‘point to clear congressional authorization’ to justify his extraordinary assertion of that power.”
> One of three justices to dissent on the Supreme Court decision said he was concerned about the “refunds of billions of dollars” that a ruling against Mr Trump’s tariffs would entail.
> In his dissent, Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote: “So the Court’s decision is not likely to greatly restrict Presidential tariff authority going forward. But the Court’s decision is likely to generate other serious practical consequences in the near term. One issue will be refunds.
> “Refunds of billions of dollars would have significant consequences for the US Treasury.
> “The Court says nothing today about whether, and if so how, the Government should go about returning the billions of dollars that it has collected from importers.”
> He added: “But that process is likely to be a ‘mess,’ as was acknowledged at oral argument.”
> A Democrat Congressman has described the Supreme Court’s opinion document as a “victory for the American people, the rule of law, and our standing in the global economy”.
> Richard Neal, a member of the House of Representatives, said “no president can invent powers they do not have”.

> The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were up between 0.1pc and 0.4pc as some companies were boosted by the ruling.
> Thousands of companies around the world have filed lawsuits challenging Mr Trump’s sweeping tariffs and sought refunds on duties paid.
> They include Goodyear, whose shares jumped 1.3pc following the ruling, and EssilorLuxottica, which was up 1.9pc.
> The Supreme Court case was a legal test of the extent of Donald Trump’s presidential powers.
> US treasury secretary Scott Bessent previously tried to play down the impact of such a ruling.
> He said the US Treasury has enough funds to cover the costs of any refunds.
> “It won’t be a problem if we have to do it, but ‍I can tell you that if it happens — which I don’t think it’s going to — it’s just a corporate boondoggle,” Mr Bessent told Reuters. “Costco, who’s suing the US government, are they going to give the money back to their clients?”
> Mr Trump’s global tariffs, which were announced in April, were challenged by 12 US states and small businesses, which accused the president of overreaching.
> The 6-3 ruling against Mr Trump comes despite the Supreme Court boasting a 6-3 conservative majority.
> Despite the legality of the tariffs hanging in the balance, this week Mr Trump said this week that any country that does business with Iran will face a tariff rate of 25 per cent on trade with the US.
> “Effective immediately, any Country doing business with the Islamic Republic of Iran will pay a Tariff of 25pc on any and all business being done with the United States of America,” the US president said in a post on social media on Monday.

> Justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas and Brett Kavanaugh dissented.
> In theory, the ruling jeopardises the trade agreements the Trump administration has secured with the likes of the UK and the European Union, which were negotiated in the context of Mr Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs.
> The US president said it would be difficult to reverse the tariffs as it would allow countries and businesses to claim refunds.
> “It would take many years to figure out what number we are talking about and even, who, when, and where, to pay”, he wrote on social media.
> “It would be a complete mess, and almost impossible for our Country to pay”, he added.
> The White House is widely expected to turn to a raft of other tools to replace the IEEPA tariff revenue and keep trade deals in place.
> In the first instance, these are likely to include Section 122 of the 1974 Trade Act, which allows the President to impose tariffs of up to 15 per cent for up to five months.
> Donald Trump’s flagship “liberation day” tariffs have been struck down by the Supreme Court in a ruling published this afternoon.
> The Supreme Court said the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) used by the White House to impose his sweeping levies “does not authorise the President to impose tariffs”.

### 2. [GDP Report Live: Despite Growth Slowdown, 'Core of the Economy is Resilient'](https://www.investopedia.com/gdp-report-live-fourth-quarter-11910438)
**Source**: Investopedia | **Date**: 2026-02-21T12:37:00+00:00

> Investopedia / Michela Buttignol
> Welcome to Investopedia's live coverage of the fourth-quarter Gross Domestic Product report. Here, we will bring you the latest economic growth data, explain its implications, and provide in-depth analysis.
> GDP grew at an annualized rate of 1.4% in the fourth quarter, down from 4.4% in the third quarter. The report was originally scheduled for Jan. 29, but was released at 8:30 a.m. ET Friday because of government shutdown-related delays.
> Follow along with our live coverage of the report below.
> Today's report doesn't signal concern for the future of economic growth, economists and analysts said.
> Because a large portion of the drag on GDP was related to the government shutdown, the rapid deceleration in economic growth is not expected to be sustained.
> In 2026, the economy could get a boost from tax refunds that will allow consumers to spend a little more early in the year, economists said. BMO Capital Markets estimates that GDP growth at year-end will be 2.5%.
> Some factors that could change outlooks include economic risks around tariffs, immigration, and other policies, as well as an uncertain trajectory for the AI boom.
> Here's What Economists Are Saying About Friday's GDP Report
> "GDP continues to highlight the economy’s strength. It has posted healthy to strong growth over the last three quarters of last year, and year-over-year growth is at least equal to potential growth, if not a bit above. Nonetheless, the economy’s growth is fragile, as evidenced by the job market."
> "The prolonged federal government shutdown and the expiry of the electric vehicle tax credit weighed on Q4 GDP growth, but the core of the economy is resilient. With tariff pressures fading and tax cuts beginning to fuel an increase in capital spending, the economy will gather momentum in 2026."
> "The U.S. economy isn't as weak as the Q4 headline figure suggests, nor was it as strong as Q3's 4.4% print suggested."
> "The negative impact from the government shutdown was very clear in this report, and we should expect to see a rebound in the first quarter due to a recovery here. ...From the Fed’s perspective, it will likely look through the noise from the shutdown, and see few signs of economic deterioration that would necessitate further rate cuts for the time being."
> "We maintain our view that economic growth will be solid and less volatile in 2026 as peak policy uncertainty is behind us. Supportive fiscal and monetary policy should help broaden out private sector hiring, and productivity growth should maintain a buoyant pace."
> While the headline fourth-quarter numbers were lower than expected, the full year's economic growth also showed a slowdown.
> GDP grew at a 2.2% pace in 2025, down from 2.8% the year prior.
> Stock Futures Slip Amid Friday's Data Reports
> Futures contracts connected to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were down 0.1% in recent trading, as were S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures.
> The 10-year Treasury yield, which influences interest rates on a variety of consumer loans, including mortgages, rose slightly to 4.07%.
> The GDP measure falling short of expectations likely played a role in the drop, but it wasn't the only data release on Friday that shook investors.
> The Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, rose 2.9% year-over-year in December, a faster rate than economists had expected. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, was in line with expectations, rising to 3% from 2.8% in November.
> Follow along with market reactions throughout the day in our live markets coverage.
> According to Friday's report by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, GDP was significantly slower in the last three months of 2025 than it was in the prior quarter.
> The BEA found that the deceleration largely "reflected downturns in government spending and exports." Economists said much of this is attributed to the government shutdown in October and November.
> Consumer spending, a main engine of the economy, also slowed but was still strong. Consumer spending "added 1.6 percentage points to growth, compared to 2.3 percentage points in the prior quarter," wrote Moody's Analytics' Scott Hoyt.
> The BEA found that the slowdown in consumer spending was "partly offset by an acceleration in investment" as companies raced to build out AI infrastructure.
> Economic Growth Was Far Slower Than Expected in the Fourth Quarter
> Inflation-adjusted gross domestic product grew at an annualized rate of 1.4% in the fourth quarter, down from 4.4% in the third quarter. It was also well below economists' expectations of a 2.4% increase.
> Friday's figures are an advance estimate that the bureau will revise twice as new data comes in. Final numbers will be released in April.
> Did the Longest-Ever Government Shutdown Affect GDP?
> On Friday morning, President Donald Trump took to social media to blame slower GDP growth on his political opponents.
> "The Democrat Shutdown cost the U.S.A. at least two points in GDP," he wrote.
> Economists say the historically long 43-day shutdown in October and November hindered economic growth.  Deutsche Bank researchers estimate that had the shutdown not happened, the economy would have grown 70 basis points more in the fourth quarter.
> They also say the shutdown wasn't the only occurrence holding the economy back.
> "[The forecasted growth level] is no small feat for an economy that had to weather a massive trade policy uncertainty shock and the longest shutdown in history last year," wrote Aditya Bhave, U.S. economist for Bank of America Securities.
> Economic Growth and Personal Finances Seem Misaligned
> The economy may be growing at a solid pace, but it doesn’t feel like it to many Americans.
> Economists are generally optimistic about the economy, but the public hasn't hated it this much in more than a decade. Consumer sentiment fell to its lowest level since 2014 in January, according to a survey by The Conference Board
> People with high incomes account for most consumer spending that is fueling the economy, while lower- and middle-income households struggle to make ends meet. Not only that, but the job boom that usually accompanies this level of economic growth is ostensibly missing.
> Trump Has Predicted Booming Economic Growth
> President Donald Trump wants the economy to achieve something rarely seen outside wartime: a 15% growth rate.
> "We should be at 15%," Trump said in an interview with FOX Business aired earlier this month. "We can grow at 15%. I think more than that."
> The president did not specify his exact growth metric or the timeframe. However, economic growth is usually expressed as the inflation-adjusted annual rate of growth of the Gross Domestic Product. If that is the goalpost, meeting it would take a miracle, or if history is a guide, a disaster.
> Real GDP usually grows at 2%-3% per year.2 GDP growth has hit double digits only in extreme circumstances, typically when the country is bouncing back from a catastrophe.
> Read more about Trump’s economic growth prediction here.
> What Happened in the Third Quarter GDP Report?
> The U.S. economy grew much faster than forecasters had expected in the third quarter, thanks to a drop in imports and a surge in consumer spending.
> The inflation-adjusted Gross Domestic Product grew at an annual rate of 4.4% in the third quarter, up from 3.8% in the second quarter.
> That blew past the 3.2% growth forecasters had expected, and was well above the 2.6% average annual growth rate over the previous four years.
> What Do Economists Expect From Today’s Report?
> The economy is likely growing at a healthy clip, avoiding both a tariff-driven slump and an AI-fueled boom.
> The Bureau of Economic Analysis is expected to report Friday that the inflation-adjusted gross domestic product grew at an annualized rate of 2.5% in the fourth quarter, down from 4.4% in the third quarter, according to a survey of economists by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal.
> A report in line with expectations would show that the economy continued to expand thanks to the massive investments in data centers that are fueling the AI arms race. The AI bump could help offset the effects of the record-long government shutdown, but it likely won't be large enough to signal a major economic boost.
> “Recent data reinforce our view that real GDP growth remains on a solidly positive trajectory, largely reflecting sturdy consumer spending and a strengthening rate of business investment,” wrote a team of Wells Fargo economists Wednesday.
> Economists often use GDP as a measure of a country’s economic health.
> It measures a country's consumer spending, government spending, net exports, and total investments. GDP typically has a limited impact on financial markets because it is backward-looking. However, GDP data can affect markets if the actual numbers differ significantly from expectations.

**Source**: interest.co.nz | **Date**: 2026-02-21T21:24:00+00:00

> This a speech the Governor of the Reserve Bank gave to delivered to Business Canterbury in Christchurch on February 20, 2026. The original is here.
> It is a pleasure to be here today. I would like to thank Business Canterbury for inviting me to speak to you all. This is my first time in Christchurch, and indeed in New Zealand’s South Island. I am already impressed by your lively and scenic city. I know that Canterbury went through a very challenging period following the earthquakes. But you have rebuilt and emerged as one of the bright spots of the New Zealand economy today. I am keen to meet with you and learn more about your region and its economy.
> Being Reserve Bank Governor comes with a profound sense of responsibility, because the decisions of the Reserve Bank have such wide-reaching impacts for New Zealanders. My focus as Governor will be on the Reserve Bank’s core mandates. For monetary policy our mandate is very clear: we’re tasked with keeping inflation low and stable.
> Today, I want to focus on the need for monetary policy to be forward looking. This is important for three main reasons. First, it takes time for changes in the Official Cash Rate (OCR) to influence the economy and inflation. Second, economic data are often highly volatile and lagged. And third, forward-looking policy helps financial markets adjust to new information.
> In practice, this means we base our monetary policy decisions on a forecast of where inflation is heading, and not on where it is today. But importantly, we learn from incoming data and adjust monetary policy as we go so that inflation converges to the target. So, being forward looking does not mean that monetary policy is on a preset course.
> Our current situation is a good example of the need to stay focused on the future. With inflation slightly above our target range, how do we ensure that inflation will return sustainably to target without stifling the nascent economic recovery? But before I explain our latest decision, let me highlight why low and stable inflation is so important.
> Keeping inflation low and stable is the best contribution monetary policy can make to helping New Zealanders
> The 1970s and 1980s show us what can happen when monetary policy does not have a clear focus on price stability. Before 1990, the government could direct the Reserve Bank in setting monetary policy, with policy settings often directed at boosting growth and employment.2
> What’s the problem with that? You could sometimes use monetary policy to give the economy a short-term rush. But what New Zealand got in this period was very high inflation with no enduring improvement in growth or employment (figure 1). Volatility in inflation and real incomes uncertainty for people and businesses trying to plan for their futures.3 Average weekly earnings were largely stagnant in inflation-adjusted terms over the 1980s.
> In 1990 the Reserve Bank was given clear responsibility for price stability, and independence to decide New Zealand’s monetary policy. Since then, New Zealand has enjoyed much lower inflation. Of course, other factors – like globalisation – helped keep inflation low too. But having an independent central bank focused on price stability has been key.4
> Low and stable inflation makes it easier for households and businesses to make decisions and plan for their futures. It helps ensure that New Zealander’s incomes and savings aren’t eroded by rapidly rising prices. And it supports healthy growth, with a strong labour market and growing real incomes.
> In recent years New Zealand, like many other countries, has experienced the pain of high inflation for the first time since the 1980s. Even though inflation has fallen since the peak in 2022, many households and businesses are still feeling the effects of several years of high inflation and weak growth. How do we ensure inflation returns sustainably to target without stifling the nascent economic recovery?
> Monetary policy decision: New Zealand’s economy has room to recover while inflation falls to 2 percent
> This week, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to leave the OCR unchanged at 2.25 precent (figure 2). The Committee emphasised that an economic recovery is underway, and that there are signs of it broadening across the economy. Inflation is slightly above our target range at 3.1 percent. However, we are confident that inflation will return to the target midpoint over the next 12 months. Let me explain how we used our future-focused Remit to guide our decision before I get into the details of the outlook for the New Zealand economy and inflation.
> We must understand the present, but look ahead to the future
> I want to stress that we are never comfortable having inflation outside our target range. But we must accept what has already happened, understand it, and then look ahead.
> That’s what our Remit asks of us: that we focus on future inflation.5
> This makes good sense. Let me give you three main reasons for this.
> Monetary policy takes time to impact the economy
> First, our monetary policy decisions take time to flow through to inflation – about 6 to 9 quarters for the peak impact.6 Increasing the OCR now would not bring inflation down immediately. But it would hamper the economic recovery. And if the recent increase in inflation proved temporary, we would risk undershooting our inflation target.
> Economic data are often volatile and lagged
> Second, economic data can be highly volatile.7 For example, for the first three quarters of 2025 New Zealand’s measured economic growth fluctuated between strongly positive and strongly negative.8 This volatility reflected many factors – including fluctuations in the timing of agricultural production, changes in energy supply for manufacturers, and changing seasonal patterns.
> Inflation is constantly pushed around by temporary changes in the prices of global commodities and services, as well as fluctuations in domestic energy prices and the ‘one-off’ effects of some central and local government policy changes.
> If we reacted to short-term economic volatility, we would simply add to it. Instead, we aim to understand what each new piece of data tells us about the fundamental drivers of inflation, and whether it represents a new trend or temporary volatility
> In reality, this is challenging, particularly in times of great uncertainty.9 In such circumstances, it may be better to publish several alternative scenarios instead of a central projection. For example, in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic the Reserve Bank published three scenarios instead of a central projection. Similarly, the Bank of Canada switched to publishing multiple scenarios for a period following US announcements of higher tariffs in April 2025.
> But even in more normal times, it is a challenge to stay focused on the future when our data are always behind us. Our latest inflation and unemployment data are for the last three months of last year, while our latest GDP data are even older, covering July to September of last year.
> Forward-looking policy helps financial markets adjust to new information
> Third, focusing on the future helps financial markets anticipate how the MPC will react to new information about inflationary pressure. This allows financial conditions to change in response to new data – in a way that helps us to achieve our mandate – even before the MPC has met to consider the new data and adjust monetary policy.
> To support this, the Reserve Bank publishes a forward-looking track for the OCR, in combination with economic projections, and a discussion of the main risks to our assessment.10 Publishing alternative scenarios more regularly can be considered to further help markets understand our reaction function.11
> Of course, given volatility in the economic data, financial markets can react strongly to movements in the data that turn out to reflect temporary factors, rather than fundamental changes in economic conditions.
> With that said, let me go into how understanding the present but looking ahead to the future is relevant for our current monetary policy stance.
> An economic recovery is underway, and there are signs it is broadening across the economy
> The economy is at an early stage in its recovery. With ongoing strength in commodity prices, economic activity in the agricultural sector and regional New Zealand remains strong. In response to lower interest rates, economic growth is broadening across sectors of the economy, such as manufacturing, construction and some retail. The chill from the surge in uncertainty about tariffs last year has partly abated.
> New Zealand’s economy expanded in the September quarter last year, and our indicators point to an ongoing recovery into the end of 2025 and the start of 2026 (figure 3).
> As for the labour market, unemployment remains elevated, and wage growth remains subdued (figure 4). But there are signs that the labour market is beginning to stabilise. The labour market often only improves once employers are confident business really is picking up, which we expect will happen this year.
> Just like the downturn, the recovery is likely to be uneven. We have already seen stronger growth in exports, business investment, and house building, compared to relatively subdued growth in household consumption. I will hear today about how the recovery is going in Canterbury, and I’m looking forward visiting other regions to hear what’s happening there.
> The path has been bumpy, but inflation is expected to return to our 2 percent target midpoint over the next 12 months
> The path lower for inflation has been a bumpy one. Annual consumer price inflation fell from its post-COVID peak of 7.3 percent in mid-2022 to 2.2 percent in the second half of 2024. It increased over 2025 to 3.1 percent in the December quarter of last year, which is just outside our 1-3 percent target range. However, we expect inflation to be back in our target range now in the first quarter of this year and to return to our target midpoint over the next 12 months (figure 5).
> This judgement is a critical part of the MPC’s forward-looking assessment and decision to hold the OCR at 2.25 percent. We needed to assess whether the recent increase in annual consumer price inflation is a sign of broader inflationary pressure, or just a temporary bump in inflation’s path lower.
> Global factors have increased inflation for goods and services that can be traded internationally
> Global factors are behind much of the recent increase in inflation in New Zealand. Many of the products New Zealand households consume can be bought on international markets. The prices we pay for these products – even the ones that are made here in New Zealand – are heavily influenced by prices in global markets.
> Inflation for tradables products picked up in 2025, after being negative in the second half of 2024 (figure 6). Rising inflation for tradable food and transport – which includes both fuel and airfares – explains much of this increase (figure 7).
> Fluctuations in tradables inflation are common and often short-lived. Looking forward, tradables inflation is expected to fall back over the next 12 months given relatively stable import prices and some support from the recent appreciation in the New Zealand dollar.
> Non-tradables inflation has been declining, but only gradually
> What about goods and services that aren’t exposed to global volatility – such as housing and local services? Prices for these ‘non-tradables’ are driven much more by what’s happening here at home. Non-tradables inflation has been declining since 2022, but it has been a slow grind lower, and non-tradables inflation has proven more stubborn than expected by the Monetary Policy Committee over the past few years (figure 8).
> The decline in non-tradables inflation has predominantly been driven by weak demand in the economy. When demand is weak, people and businesses compete less for goods and services and productive inputs, and inflationary pressure in the economy falls.
> This has been the case in New Zealand over the past two years – weak demand in the economy has kept a lid on these pressures (figure 9, green bars). Weak demand is expected to continue to pull non-tradables inflation down over 2026, but by less and less as the economy recovers.
> With weak demand in the economy, why hasn’t non-tradables inflation fallen faster? In other words, why has non-tradables inflation been so persistent? An important reason for this is that the pricing decisions of firms and workers have been slow to adjust back to a low inflation environment.
> When inflation is high, businesses tend to increase their prices to catch up with or get ahead of rising input costs and workers try to negotiate higher pay rises, so the purchasing power of their incomes does not fall behind. These decisions add up to keep inflation higher for longer, with persistent effects that can be felt for years.
> We think this process has been slowing down as headline inflation has declined, and that it will slow further as households and businesses continue to adjust back to a low-inflation environment (figure 9, blue bars). Consistent with this, expectations for future inflation are well within our inflation target band (figure 10).
> Another key reason why non-tradables inflation has been higher than expected over recent quarters is that prices for some categories of non-tradables products have continued to increase even though demand in the economy has been weak (figure 11).12 Eventually, prices for these products will respond to the lower inflation environment.
> Lastly, administered prices – which are prices more directly influenced by central and local government policies – have been increasing strongly over recent quarters, adding persistence to non-tradables inflation (figure 12).
> For example, council rates have been increasing more quickly than overall inflation, and it is unclear how long this will persist. But other recent drivers of administered price inflation – like those from increased electricity lines charges and changes to fees free education – are expected to exert less upward pressure on inflation over 2026.
> Underlying inflationary pressures are lower than headline CPI inflation
> There are always various factors influencing inflation, making it harder to discern the underlying trends. We need to look into the details. We also have tools that help us to step back from the details to get a feel for underlying inflationary pressures in the economy. These tools produce measures of ‘core inflation’ that strip out or put less weight on prices that tend to be volatile. Currently, our measures of core inflation are telling us that underlying inflationary pressure in New Zealand is not as high as the headline CPI suggests (figure 13).
> Core inflation being stable and within the target band is consistent with our forecast for inflation to fall over 2026.
> New Zealand’s economy has room to recover while inflation heads towards 2 percent
> What does all this mean for 2026? We expect declining tradables inflation to bring New Zealand’s inflation rate back within our target range, while the more persistent inflation pressures continue on their gradual path lower. This will provide the New Zealand economy with room to further recover, without a lift-off in inflation.
> That is a positive outlook for 2026. But it doesn’t mean we can put our feet up. Forecasting inflation is never easy – we have thought of many ways in which we might be wrong. And today’s volatile world only promises to deliver more curve balls. You only have to look at the growth in artificial intelligence and the major shifts in geopolitical relationships to know that the world is changing. The transition is unlikely to be a smooth one. Eyes on the horizon: Looking ahead in a volatile world 13
> Risks to the inflation outlook are balanced, but monetary policy is not on a preset course
> Importantly, being forward focused, as I’ve discussed, does not imply that monetary policy is on a pre-set course. We will adjust our plans as we get new information, and always with a focus on the future.
> I recently learned a Māori whakataukī: Kia whakatōmuri te haere whakamua. It’s about looking back and reflecting so you can move forward. And that’s exactly what we do. Our experience of the past – of economic cycles, of unexpected shocks, and of volatility in the data – helps us to understand what each new piece of data might tell us about the future.
> We know that the economy will never evolve exactly as we expect. But we should strive to set policy for the future, to stay focused on the goal, and to not overreact to volatility in the data.
> The Monetary Policy Committee has a clear mandate, to guide inflation back to target in all sorts of conditions. We will continue to look ahead and respond to what the world delivers.

> AI Summit 2026 LIVE: The AI Impact Summit 2026 that is being hosted at the Bharat Mandapam has entered its fifth and penultimate day today, 20 February. This is also the last day where speakers from different companies, countries and organisations will deliver addresses and engage in fireside chats.
> Dozens of world leaders and ministers are expected to deliver on Friday a shared view of how to handle artificial intelligence, wrapping up the five-day summit focused on AI.
> However, on the last day of the summit, at least 10 Youth Congress workers staged a protest at the Bharat Mandapam against India's foreign policy.
> The India AI Impact Summit 2026 is the first of its kind being held in the Global South, and the fourth annual gathering to discuss the risks and opportunities posed by rapidly advancing computing power.
> On Thursday, the India AI Summit 2026 saw a number of world leaders, CEOs and business leaders from across the globe come together to share their views on artificial intelligence and announce dozens of deals.
> India expects more than $200 billion in investments over the next two years, and US tech titans unveiled new deals and infrastructure projects this week.
> Where to watch the AI Impact Summit LIVE?
> More than 700 sessions are planned across the summit’s duration, spanning themes such as AI safety, governance, ethics, data protection, sovereign AI capabilities and the future of work.
> All events from the summit will be broadcast live on the official IndiaAI YouTube channel here — https://youtube.com/@indiaai
> The live telecast will cover keynote addresses, ministerial dialogues, CEO sessions, thematic discussions and Expo walkthroughs.
> Track for LIVE updates on the AI Impact Summit today
> Chinmay Pandya, Chairperson of SAIPR, highlighted the significant potential of Artificial Intelligence in India at the India AI Impact Summit held in New Delhi, while also stressing the need for ethical guidelines and regulatory mechanisms.
> Pandya, in a conversation with ANI, on the sidelines of the AI Summit on Friday, said, "There is certainly unprecedented potential for India. Where there is fire, there is smoke. The advent of AI will certainly increase accessibility. AI is dominating every aspect of health, education, governance, warfare, but if ethical guidelines and regulatory mechanisms are not developed at the right time, it could fall into the wrong hands, which is a matter of concern. Keeping this in mind, we are holding an AI for Democracy talk here today."

> Sanjeev Bikhchandani, Founder of Info Edge told ANI, "India will get a lot in the AI summit. I think what the AI summit has done is bring all Indian AI companies and technologies onto one platform for everyone to see. Awareness has spread. The general public has got aware of AI. You saw the crowds here. So I think massive awareness all around will help the spread of AI.
> On protest by Indian Youth Congress workers at AI Impact Summit, an eyewitness says, "Sumit Patni told ANI, " As a visitor, I feel this is not the right place to hold such a protest. It gives a bad image to the country. This is not a place for protest, where India is holding an international event and talking about AI. Such a protest should not happen.

> Cristiano Amon, CEO and President of Qualcomm at the Summit, was quoted by ANI as saying, "We're heading to the next big transformation of the telecom sector. 6G is going to provide an evolution of connectivity, faster speed, lower latency, higher coverage, but that's not the story. That's just a piece of the story. It's just continue to improve the connectivity.
> He added, "The big part of 6G is AI, like I said before, is now going to come to the telecom network. And that becomes a large-scale AI network that is processing and gets trained on all of the signals that happen at the network, and provides new capabilities. One of the biggest features of 6G is that the network is the sensing network at scale..."
> “Congress has once again proven that for them, AI isn't Ambitious India, Artificial Intelligence, Aspirational India. For them, AI is anti-India. This isn't the INC, this is the ANC, the anti-National Congress. The AI ​​Summit is being praised worldwide. From President Macron to the United Nations Secretary General, to top tech company honchos, from Sam Altman to Sundar Pichai, everyone is praising it. Even Shashi Tharoor said the AI ​​Summit was excellent. But at Rahul Gandhi's behest, the Congress party is protesting; it is a characterless, brainless, emotionless protest. This isn't a protest against the BJP, it's not a protest against the PM, it's a protest against India's achievements,” says BJP's Shehzad Poonawalla.

> At least 10 protesters stormed into the AI Impact Summit on its last day.
> Delhi Police says it is taking legal action in connection with the protest by the Indian Youth Congress, as per an ANI report.
> “When foreign policy leans, corporate pressure and silence prevail… then it’s clear, PM Modi is COMPROMISED,” the Youth Congress wrote in a post on X.
> “To expose this very truth, the fearless workers of the Indian Youth Congress reached the AI Summit and staged a protest against the “Compromised PM”! No compromise with the nation’s honor!” it added.
> Youth Congress workers storm AI Summit. Watch
> Indian Youth Congress workers staged a topless protest and chanted anti-Modi slogans at Bharat Mandapam over US deal.
> “Today, due to climate change, we need climate-proof agriculture, and AI has the potential to do that. So, we are already using AI. We have started MahaVISTAAR. Through it, we have around 2.5 million farmers on our app, and that is a one-stop solution for all the farmers,” says Devendra Fadnavis.
> “I am leaving so energised as this has been such a fantastic event. I congratulate India and PM Modi on this event. The topics discussed were spot on about safety, accessibility and penness. I am pleased that there is also an AI Pact between India and Germany to move things forward together,” says Karsten Wildberger, German Federal Minister for Digital Transformation & Govt Modernisation.
> “Our Prime Minister is promoting India's AI globally. This is an inspiring time. Everything is happening in India. India will provide global leadership in AI and related industries. Not just AI, integrated data centres, AI, quantum, you name it. We are very happy. Things are happening positively. We are living in an inspiring time. Everybody has to work in that direction,” says N Chandrababu Naidu.
> “We're thrilled that India joined Pax Silica... If you saw the companies that are represented here today, this is an incredible partnership for both of our nations, and we look forward to taking it to the next level,” says Sergio Gor.
> “There is lot of excitement, huge participation; A big win for India at the global stage and an acknowledgement of India's talent,” says Union minister Jayant Chaudhary.
> “AI can have a lot of very positive impact in healthcare, particularly since we know that we have a lot of places in India as well as in other parts of the world like Africa where we don't have specialists, you don't have radiologists, psychiatrists, pathologists. One very simple solution of AI is image recognition or pattern recognition. So, reading X-rays, reading pathology slides, those things can be done quite well, provided the algorithm is trained well on a good data set. So those are kinds of things which are already being widely used. We are seeing a lot of new applications as well. What I would recommend is that, just like when we introduce a new drug or a vaccine, we do a clinical trial. We need to assess the efficacy and the safety of any new AI product before it is scaled up. That should be in the regulatory pathway,” says former WHO Deputy Director General Soumya Swaminathan.
> “This is a historical summit in the Global South, and the Prime Minister Modi is really trying to include the Global South in this essential new wave of technology, which is AI, which will transform our lives. Yes, India definitely is becoming a new hub for AI,” says Brazil's Ambassador to India Kenneth Félix Haczynski da Nóbrega.
> “The semiconductor supply chain is very important for the entire world. There is a need for a resilient supply chain. We have seen the kind of disruptions which happened during COVID, and it can also be weaponised. So that's why today the entire world is looking at India as a trusted country. Our Prime Minister Narendra Modi has positioned India as a trusted country which believes in freedom and democracy...It's a very important historical event for us because our semiconductor industry has evolved very well in the last decade,” says Ashwini Vaishnaw.
> “India is such a big country, while Israel is a small country with only 10 million people. But the solutions for the two countries can be the same or converge. In working with India to bring solutions for the scale of India is very important. We are hearing a lot of responsible AI, but first of all, we need to identify the challenges and develop solutions,” says Ilan Fluss, EDTs Policy Coordinator at Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
> “Technology creates a foundation for people to stand taller and reach higher,” says Microsoft President Brad Smith.
> He highlighted how AI can unlock new opportunities and benefit everyone.
> Andhra Pradesh CM N Chandrababu Naidu arrives at Bharat Mandapam to attend AI Impact Summit 2026 that is being hosted in New Delhi.
> “Pax Silica initiative will bring the technology collaboration closer between the US and India,” says Micron Technology CEO Sanjay Mehrotra.
> “India has become a part of the Pax Silica. This will greatly benefit India's electronics and semiconductor industry… A complete ecosystem is emerging in India. Pax Silica will be crucial for this, and the youth of India will benefit from it,” says Ashwini Vaishnaw
> “Once we understand what systems can do and what they cannot, we can move from rough measures to smarter, risk-based guardrails. Guardrails that protect people, uphold human rights, and preserve human agency. Guardrails that build confidence and give business clarity so innovation can move faster in the right direction. Science-led governance is not a brake on progress. It is an accelerator for solutions... It helps us identify where AI can do the most good the fastest, and it helps us anticipate early impacts from risks for children to labour markets to manipulation at scale, so countries can prepare, protect, and invest in people,” says UN Secretary General António Guterres.
> “India's entry into Pax Silica is not just symbolic. It is strategic and essential. India is a nation with deep talent, deep enough to rival challengers. India's engineering depth offers critical capabilities for this vital coalition. In addition to talent, India has made important strides towards critical mineral processing capacity, and that is something that we are also fully engaged in,” says Sergio Gor.

### 3. [India's AI future needs Rare Earth Magnets: Decoding the global supply chain from China to the US, Australia, Brazil etal](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/portfolio/big-story/rare-earth-elements-ai-supply-chain-india/article70655645.ece)
**Source**: The Hindu BusinessLine | **Date**: 2026-02-21T17:04:00+00:00

> At the recently-concluded India AI Impact Summit in New Delhi this week, CEOs Sam Altman, Sundar Pichai, Demis Hassabis and Dario Amodei took centre stage. The spotlight, though, was on the same stack: AI models, chips and data centres, the machinery behind ChatGPT, Gemini, DeepSeek and Claude, typically powered by Nvidia GPUs. But AI needs a physical system. It must store data, move parts with microscopic precision and cool power-hungry servers. That is where Rare Earth Elements (REEs) enter the scene, mainly through permanent magnets, which retain magnetism without continuous external power. Neodymium magnets also sit inside the high-efficiency motors that keep data centres running, powering fans, pumps and compressors that move air and chilled water/coolant with precision. As AI is increasingly embedded in robots and automation, this magnet dependence only grows. The same rare earth magnets sit inside EV motors (from BYD, Tesla and many other mass-market EV makers), wind turbines from manufacturers such as Siemens Gamesa and Vestas and industrial robots from ABB and KUKA. They are also in defence systems such as radar and guidance components.
> REEs may not be visible to consumers like gold or silver, but they are embedded deep inside modern machinery. The oddity is economic: Global rare earth output is large in tonnage at 390,000 tonnes (USGS), yet small in headline market value at less than $7 billion (industry estimates), because the real leverage is strategic, not size. Production is heavily concentrated. China dominates rare earth mining. But its stronger position lies in processing: Various estimates put China’s share of global separation/refining capacity at 90 per cent, which is why it sits at the choke point between ore and magnets. When export controls were tightened by the country last year, it showed how fast supply chains can choke, sending automobile companies scrambling for supplies.
> That is one of the many reasons why countries are building mine-to-magnet capacity at home using stakes, funding and offtakes, and why India (the world’s third-largest reserves of rare earths at 6.9 million tonnes), is pushing a critical minerals mission to avoid staying only a buyer in someone else’s supply system. Governments around the world are no longer treating rare earths like a normal commodity. In the US, policy has turned openly strategic, including under Donald Trump, with support for domestic mines, stockpiles and overseas sourcing to reduce dependence on China. The race is also widening the map and the capital pool. Greenland is often cited for large deposits. Kenya’s Mrima Hill, reportedly holding over 40 million tonnes of rare earth-bearing ore resources, has made headlines. Ukraine features in the broader critical-minerals narrative. Hence, rare earths as a topic keep resurfacing in policy and boardrooms.
> REEs are a group of 17 chemical elements. They include 15 closely-related metals called lanthanides, such as neodymium and dysprosium, which are used to make high-strength magnets. Scandium and yttrium are also grouped together with lanthanides because they occur in the same deposits and share similar chemical behaviour. The ‘rare’ in rare earth metals, however, is a sort of a misnomer. “Rare earth elements is a terrible name because they’re everywhere; they’re not rare at all,” as US Energy Secretary Chris Wright puts it. In fact, cerium is roughly as abundant as, say, copper, in the Earth’s crust. What makes them economically rare is that they’re dispersed in low concentrations (often occur at just a few grams per tonne of rock). Plus, they are chemically difficult to separate, as sorting often involves hundreds of stages to isolate individual rare earths.
> Historically, REEs were first discovered in 1787 in a small village called Ytterby in Sweden, where miners found an unusual black mineral that led to the identification of several new metals over the next century. For much of the 20th century, rare earth production was led by the US, especially from the Mountain Pass mine in California. The desert open-pit rare-earth mine in California’s Mojave was at one point supplying 70 per cent of global rare earths until the early 1980s. From the 1980s, China under Deng Xiaoping’s reform-era leadership invested heavily in mining and, more importantly, in the complex chemical processing needed to separate these metals. From the 1990s, US production kept on declining too. Over time, lower costs, including cheap labour and relaxed environmental standards, and State support helped China build dominance across the rare earth supply chain. This turned what was once a niche scientific curiosity into a strategically-important industrial resource today.
> Make no mistake, not all rare earths are equally valuable. Rare earths rarely trade as pure metals; they are typically processed and priced first as oxides, which are then converted into metals and magnet alloys. Recent benchmark quotes show lanthanum oxide selling in the low single-digit dollars per kg, while neodymium oxide trades in the low-$100s per kg. Dysprosium, used in smaller volumes but critical for high-temperature magnets, trades at a large premium because it’s heavy rare earth. This wide dispersion in value is important. A handful of elements such as neodymium, praseodymium and dysprosium drive most of the industry’s economics, largely because they are used to make permanent magnets.
> But these metals do not come out of the ground as neat, tradable powders. They start as messy rocks and sands, and the real story begins with where they are found and how they are separated.
> In rare earths, mining gets the headlines, separation is the moat but magnets are the prize. To understand where the money is made, it helps to follow the rare earth metals value chain.
> Mining is only the first step. Rare earth ores such as bastnäsite, monazite or ion-adsorption clays are extracted from the ground. These ores are then concentrated and chemically processed to produce rare earth oxides (REOs). Processing can cost several times more than mining. The oxides are refined further into metals or alloys. Those alloys are then used to manufacture high-strength permanent magnets. Finally, the magnets are built into motors, turbines and electronic components.
> At each stage, value increases. A tonne of ore has relatively low economic value. But a back-of-the-envelope calculation show a tonne of separated neodymium oxide can be roughly 3,500 times the value of a tonne of ore. Finished Neodymium-Iron-Boron magnet material typically sits around 1,600-2,200 times the ore value and can be higher for premium grades. According to US Geological Survey data, magnets are the largest rare earth end-use globally, followed by catalysts and polishing; other applications span metallurgy/alloys, ceramics, glass, phosphors and pigments. This explains why control over processing and magnet manufacturing carries more economic weight than mining alone. The chemistry involved in separating rare earths is complex, capital intensive and environmentally sensitive. Solvent extraction plants require technical expertise built over decades. That processing capability has become the real bottleneck in the supply chain.
> China controls this bottleneck. Of the total global rare earth production, China accounts for roughly 270,000 tonnes. The US is at 51,000 tonnes. Australia is at 29,000 tonnes, while India produces just about 2,900 tonnes. The headline number often quoted is China’s share of mining, but its stronger position lies in refining and downstream conversion. China controls the overwhelming majority of rare earth separation capacity and magnet production. Even when REO is mined in other countries, it is frequently shipped to China for processing. This dominance did not appear overnight. Supply risk quickly translates into price volatility because the market is relatively small and specialised.
> In response, other countries have begun building alternative supply chains.
> The US has moved beyond policy statements into direct capital deployment. In 2025, the US Department of Defense (DoD) invested $400 million in MP Materials, alongside a $150-million DoD loan to expand heavy rare-earth separation at Mountain Pass and plans tied to scaling magnet capacity. In 2026, the US also agreed to take a 10 per cent stake in USA Rare Earth as part of a reported $1.6-billion debt-and-equity package.
> Japan has used its State-backed financing ecosystem to lock in non-China supply. State entity JOGMEC and conglomerate Sojitz have repeatedly supported Lynas (Australia) to secure rare earth supply to Japanese industry, including equity-style support routed through the Japan-Australia Rare Earths (JARE) structure for Lynas’ expansion and heavy rare-earth capability.
> Australia’s role is anchored by Lynas Rare Earths, widely cited as the largest producer outside China. It is increasingly linked into allied supply chains via Japan (Sojitz/JOGMEC) and the US.
> Europe’s approach is a mix of regulation, project fast-tracking and industrial capacity. The EU Critical Raw Materials Act is being operationalised via a first list of 47 “Strategic Projects” intended to accelerate permitting and improve access to finance across extraction, processing and recycling.
> Canada is explicitly building midstream capability rather than only mining. The Saskatchewan Research Council (SRC) has been scaling a rare-earth processing and metals capability in Saskatoon (government-backed), aiming to produce NdPr (Neodymium-Praseodymium) metals at high purity and ramp monthly output.
> Brazil is emerging as a key “outside-China” source, particularly for heavy rare-earth-rich output, with explicit US backing. In February 2026, a $565-million financing from the US International Development Finance Corporation to Serra Verde included an option for the US to take a minority equity stake; Serra Verde achieved commercial production in 2024.
> India sits in a paradoxical spot in the rare earths supply chain (see table).
> It has meaningful geology, but limited industrial depth. India holds about 6 per cent of global rare earth reserves, with deposits concentrated in shoreline areas of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Gujarat, and exploration activity also visible in Rajasthan. Yet, India contributes less than 1 per cent of global REE mining. The import dependence is even sharper in magnets: India imports an estimated 80-90 per cent of magnets and related materials from China. Demand is rising fast. India’s consumption of rare earth permanent magnets is expected to double by 2030.
> Policy response has accelerated in recent times, with magnets as the near-term focal point. In November 2025, the Union Cabinet approved a ₹7,300-crore Rare Earth Permanent Magnets (REPM) scheme. Under the scheme, selected manufacturers would  receive capital- and sales-linked incentives to produce 6,000 tonnes a year of permanent magnets within seven years. On February 19, 2026, the Mining Minister was quoted as saying that India aims to start producing REPM by 2026-end in partnership with the private sector; the Ministry and a State-run body have developed the technology, and plans include setting up four critical mineral processing plants across as many States. In the recent Budget speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman proposed special Rare Earth Corridors in mineral-rich states like Odisha, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. On February 21, India and Brazil signed/announced a total of ten agreements and MoUs, including ones on critical minerals and rare earths. An effective alliance with Brazil will reduce India’s dependence on supplies from China. “The agreement on critical minerals and rare earths is a decisive step towards building resilient supply chains,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi said.
> Magnets cannot be ring-fenced from mining, separation and metallurgy. The National Critical Mineral Mission (NCMM) is meant to push the full chain — accelerating exploration and processing, maintaining stockpiles and strengthening value chains from mining to recycling. The mission’s exploration push runs into the scale problem. Resources need to be proven into mineable reserves, and India is still early in that conversion. The Indian Bureau of Mines (IBM) has compiled data showing over 29 lakh tonnes of estimated REE resources, with Maharashtra alone at 41 per cent (over 12 lakh tonnes) and Gujarat next (11 lakh tonnes). IBM also notes India has over 58 crore tonnes of REE ore (earth/waste rock from which REEs must be extracted), but extraction at scale is yet to begin and none of it has been converted into a mining block.
> Exploration and supply-side experiments are widening. All these signal a push to extract value from mining wastes.
> On the industrial side, miniratna company Indian Rare Earths Ltd (IREL) remains the primary government-owned producer and processor of rare earth compounds. It is linked to downstream capability-building including an upcoming facility to produce samarium-cobalt magnets.
> India currently has no pure-play, listed rare-earth miner/refiner. Globally, rare earths investing is really a supply-chain bet, not just a mining bet (see table).
> Only a few names have meaningful operating revenue; several “Western” listings are still developers or early-scale processors, so outcomes hinge more on commissioning, recoveries, unit costs, funding runway and offtake terms than on spot rare-earth prices. P/E may not be a useful yardstick across the set because most are loss-making; even where it exists, it can be distorted by one-offs or small profit bases.
> At one end are producers trying to prove “ore to oxide” scale outside China. MP Materials is the most direct US-listed pathway, anchored by Mountain Pass and a push into downstream magnets. Lynas plays a similar role as one of the few meaningful rare-earth producers outside China. Iluka’s angle is future processing capacity via the Eneabba refinery, while Arafura and American Rare Earths sit earlier on the curve, with execution and permitting risk dominating the return profile.
> A second bucket is “processing, metals and magnets”. Neo Performance Materials offers exposure to value-added materials that sit closer to end-use customers. Australian Strategic Materials is positioned as a mine-to-metals story with an operating metals plant footprint in Korea, while Ucore is effectively a technology-and-processing call where separation capability is the key variable. JL MAG is the downstream proxy.
> China-listed names represent incumbency and scale. China Northern Rare Earth and Shenghe sit closer to the upstream and separation backbone, benefitting from integrated capacity and domestic demand.
> Takeaway: The stocks discussed above are not recommendations. They are mere examples of the REE ecosystem and investors are expected to track their financials as the sector gains more prominence. Assess REE stocks by where they sit in the chain (mine, separation, metals, magnets) and how proven the asset is (operating vs development). Track execution milestones over narratives: Commissioning progress, recoveries, unit costs, offtake terms, funding runway and balance-sheet resilience. Watch out for new entrants.

> Stocks fell on Thursday, snapping a three-day winning streak for the S&P 500 and the Dow, as oil prices rose to a six-month high amid escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran.
> The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average led indexes lower, falling 0.5%. The benchmark S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite each slipped 0.3%. The major indexes posted respectable gains yesterday as pressure on tech stocks eased.
> Shares of Walmart (WMT) slipped 1.5% despite reporting a strong quarter of sales growth. In other earnings news, Carvana (CVNA) shares skidded 8% after the online used car seller's missed estimates on some key profitability metrics. Doordash (DASH) stock rose 1.5% after the delivery service said it expects users to spend more on its platform this quarter than analysts expected, a forecast that offset otherwise weak results.
> Big tech stocks were mixed on Thursday following reports ChatGPT maker OpenAI is set to close a $100 billion funding round. The unprofitable startup has committed to spending hundreds of billions of dollars on computing capacity over the next few years. Shares of Apple (AAPL) fell more than 1%, while Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOG), and Microsoft (MSFT) posted small losses. Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Broadcom (AVGO) and Tesla (TSLA) inched higher.
> Oil prices climbed to their highest level since August as the U.S. built up its military presence in the Middle East amid tense negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program. West Texas Intermediate futures, the U.S. crude oil benchmark, rose about 2% at $66.55 a barrel. Gold prices ticked up 0.2% to $5,015 an ounce, and silver rose 0.7% to $78.20 an ounce.
> The 10-year Treasury yield, which impacts interest rates on a variety of consumer loans including mortgages, was recently 4.07%, down slightly from Wednesday's close at 4.08%.
> Bitcoin was recently trading around $67,000 after slipping below $66,000 earlier in the session. The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the value of the greenback against a basket of currencies, rose 0.1% to 97.80.
> Deere Stock Keeps hitting Record Highs
> Deere's stock is building on its winning streak.
> Shares of Deere & Co. (DE) jumped nearly 12% to a fresh high Thursday, extending their recent record-setting rally, after the farm and construction equipment maker posted earnings that exceeded expectations.
> Deere reported earnings per share of $2.42 on revenue that rose 13% year-over-year to $9.61 billion in its fiscal first quarter. Both figures topped analysts' projections compiled by Visible Alpha.
> Deere's Manager of Investor Communications Chris Seibert said in Thursday's earnings call that infrastructure spending by the Trump administration and data center construction projects helped bolster its results, according to a transcript provided by AlphaSense.
> "While the global large agriculture industry continues to experience challenges, we're encouraged by the ongoing recovery in demand within both the construction and small agriculture segments," CEO John May said in a statement.
> Those positive demand trends have the company expecting this year could be "the bottom of the current cycle" May said, leaving Deere poised for stronger sales growth in 2027 and beyond.
> Looking ahead, Deere said it expects net income of $4.5 billion and $5 billion for the full year, up from the previous range of $4 billion to $4.75 billion, and above the $4.43 billion analysts were looking for.
> The company said sales from its Production & Precision Agriculture segment are seen falling 5% to 10%, while small agriculture and construction sales are projected to rise about 15%.
> With Thursday's move, Deere shares have gained more than 40% since the start of the year.
> Booking Holdings Stock Slumps as Room Booking Growth Expected To Slow
> Shares of Booking Holdings (BKNG) slumped on Thursday despite beating estimates across key metrics with its fourth-quarter earnings report.
> Booking on Wednesday evening reported room nights, a measure of hotel occupancy, grew 9% in the quarter, three percentage points above the upper end of company guidance. Adjusted EBITDA growth accelerated to 19% from 15% in the prior quarter.
> “We remain focused on our key priorities, especially advancing our use of Generative AI to enhance the value we deliver to both travelers and partners,” said CEO Glenn Fogel in a press release. Booking plans to reinvest $700 million in strategic initiatives around generative AI, expanding its Asia and U.S. businesses, growing its advertising business, and enhancing its fintech offerings.
> Bank of America analysts noted strategic reinvestments will likely slow the company’s pace of margin expansion, a possible rational for the stock’s weakness Thursday. Investors may also be disappointed by aspects of the company’s guidance, including its forecast that room night growth will decelerate in the current quarter.
> Shares of Booking Holdings were down more than 7% in recent trading. The stock has lost more than a quarter of its value since the start of the year.
> Carvana Stock Drops 10% Thursday, Deepening Its Recent Rout. Here’s Why
> Carvana stock was driving in reverse on Thursday.
> Shares of Carvana (CVNA) were down nearly 10% to $327 in recent trading after the online used car marketplace reported weakness in some key profitability metrics that outweighed solid sales numbers.
> The company's gross profit per unit declined year-over-year and came in below analysts' expectations at $6,427 for the fourth quarter. The company said in its letter to shareholders that some costs were higher than anticipated.
> Carvana also warned it could face elevated vehicle reconditioning costs in the first quarter, though it expects per-vehicle profits to improve.
> For the full year, Carvana said it forecasts "significant growth" in vehicle sales volume and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), but the company declined to provide specific figures in its forecasts for the current quarter or full year.
> Analysts from Wedbush and JPMorgan cut their price targets for Carvana to $425 and $490, respectively, following the results. Still, both firms said they remain bullish on Carvana's potential for gains, pointing to its strong sales growth.
> Carvana reported a 58% year-over-year jump in revenue to $5.6 billion in the fourth quarter, topping the analyst consensus compiled by Visible Alpha.
> While ratings are still in flux, Wall Street analysts are widely bullish on the stock. Twelve of the 13 analysts tracked by Visible Alpha have issued "buy" or equivalent recommendations, compared to one neutral rating. Their average price target of $450 would suggest nearly 30% upside from the stock's recent level.
> With Thursday's drop, Carvana shares have lost about one-quarter of their value since the start of the year.
> Herbalife Stock Soars as Cristiano Ronaldo Invest $7.5M in Subsidiary
> Shares of Herbalife (HLF) soared on Thursday after the health and wellness company announced a splashy investment in a tech-focused subsidiary.
> Soccer legend and longtime partner Cristiano Ronaldo acquired a 10% stake in HBL Pro2col, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Herbalife, for $7.5 million, according to a company press release. Ronaldo, who has partnered with Herbalife for more than a decade, will also “provide services and sponsorship rights” to Pro2col as part of the deal.
> Pro2col is a “next-generation, digital, personalized health and wellness operating system” that  tracks user behavior to inform custom wellness plans.
> Ronaldo's "investment reflects a shared belief in the power of nutrition, data, AI, and personalized insights to drive better health outcomes, and reinforces his confidence in the future impact of Pro2col,” said Herbalife CEO Stephan Gratziani.
> Shares of Herbalife were up 19% in recent trading, and has gained 50% since the start of the year.
> Etsy Stock Has Had a Rough Time Of It. Here's Why It's Rising Today.
> Etsy is getting a lift today—for selling a business for less than it paid to buy it.
> The morning's rise in Etsy (ETSY) shares, recently up 9% to around $48, illustrates the long journey the crafts marketplace company's stock has been on since its pandemic highs, when shares traded in the neighborhood of $300 apiece. While today's move is notable, the shares are still down this year and over the past 12 months.
> The sale was announced yesterday: Etsy said it would hand Depop, a fashion marketplace for consumers, over to eBay (EBAY) for $1.2 billion in cash. (Shares of eBay were up about 5% this morning. Read Investopedia's full markets roundup here.) That news closed the book on a $1.6 billion acquisition Etsy announced in 2021.
> Etsy is characterizing the sale as letting it focus on its core Etsy marketplace, which as of the end of 2025 had nearly 87 million buyers but saw global merchandise sales fall year-over-year. (Roughly 90% of the company's "GMS," the company says, came from the Etsy marketplace.) When it acquired Depop, Etsy sought to define itself as a "house of brands" that also included Reverb and Elo7. Now, it's moved on from all three of the other properties.
> “We are excited that this transaction allows us to focus exclusively on the compelling opportunity we see in front of us: to grow the Etsy marketplace in ways that matter most to our buyers and sellers,” said Etsy CEO Kruti Patel Goyal. “We believe this transaction is a great outcome for Etsy’s shareholders, and a positive next step for all involved."
> That's encouraging investors today. Wall Street analysts are broadly bullish on Etsy's stock, though their $67 mean price target, per Visible Alpha, still falls well short of its apex.
> Fed Minutes Show Division as Rate Cuts Remain on the Table
> The Federal Reserve is still leaning toward cutting interest rates again this year, but the readout of its latest meeting shows all the reasons why it may not.
> The minutes of January’s meeting, released on Wednesday, displayed the clear division at the Fed over where it should go next after cutting rates three times in 2025.
> Most still think “further downward adjustments” are likely still necessary if inflation keeps decelerating, the minutes show. That’s in line with markets’ current expectations of a couple of rate cuts later this year.
> But with inflation still a bit above the Fed’s 2% target, some central bank officials appeared more reluctant. They argued that cutting rates more than necessary may push up prices again, undercutting their efforts to quell the inflation that spiked in 2022.
> “Several participants cautioned that easing policy further in the context of elevated inflation readings could be misinterpreted as implying diminished policymaker commitment to the 2% inflation objective, perhaps making higher inflation more entrenched,” the FOMC minutes said.
> Indeed, several of them even thought the Fed’s communications should remove the current bias toward cutting rates again, the minutes show.
> While the Fed kept rates steady at 3.5% to 3.75% in January, its statement said officials would consider the “extent and timing of additional adjustments” —a signal that rate cuts were more likely than not. The minutes released Wednesday showed several “would have supported a two-sided description,” reflecting that rate hikes are just as possible if inflation remains above 2%.
> Few analysts see the Fed hiking rates this year, but the minutes nonetheless underline Fed officials’ focus on fully bringing inflation back to 2%. The most recent reading, from December, showed annual inflation was still slightly above 2.5%.
> “We must remain focused on our headline inflation objective; otherwise, I believe there is a real risk that inflation will get stuck closer to 3% than 2% in the long run,” Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid said last week.
> U.S. Stocks Are Having a Rough Start to the Year
> It's a big year for international sporting competition—the Winter Olympics, this summer's World Cup. In the stock market, the U.S. is losing badly.
> U.S. stocks are off to their worst start to a year relative to the rest of the world since 1995, according to a recent Goldman Sachs note.
> The MSCI World ex-USA Index, which tracks large-and mid-cap stocks in every developed market except the U.S., is up 8.2% so far this year, nearly six percentage points ahead of the equivalent index that includes the U.S. The S&P 500, the benchmark U.S. equities index, is essentially flat for the year.
> After years of outperformance, U.S. stocks began to trail the rest of the world last year. Elevated U.S. stock valuations, geopolitical and economic uncertainty, stimulus measures abroad, and a weakening U.S. dollar all played a part in the reversal of fortunes. Since the start of 2025, major indexes tracking the European market, developed markets in Asia, and global emerging markets have all more than doubled the S&P 500’s approximately 17% return.
> The divergence has accelerated this year. All but one major European stock market is pacing the S&P 500 this year. Belgian, Norwegian, and Turkish benchmarks are all up double digits this year. Denmark, the sole outlier, has been weighed down by shares of GLP-1 pioneer Novo Nordisk (NVO), which is feeling the pressure in a fiercely competitive weight loss market.
> In Asia, Korea’s KOSPI Composite has soared nearly 35% in just the last month and a half. Some of the index’s largest components, including chip giants Samsung and SK Hynix, are riding a surge in AI-related data center spending.
> Meanwhile, the tech stocks that led the S&P 500 to a series of record highs over the past year have been a drag on the index in recent months. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS), composed of seven tech companies with market caps ranging from $1.5 trillion to $4.5 trillion, is down more than 6% this year.
> What To Expect From Friday's Inflation Report
> The Fed's inflation benchmark likely worsened, not improved, over 2025.
> A report from the Bureau of Economic Analysis on Friday will likely show consumer prices as measured by Personal Consumption Expenditures rose 2.8% over 12 months through December, according to a survey of economists by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal. "Core" PCE, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is forecast to rise 3.0%, up from 2.8% in November.
> That would put both measures slightly higher than they were in January 2025. The expected rise in core PCE inflation could be especially notable because that's the yardstick the Federal Reserve uses to gauge its 2% annual inflation target.
> Michael Nagle / Bloomberg via Getty Images
> If the report matches expectations, it could throw some cold water on the optimism that arose in financial markets last week when another inflation measure, the Consumer Price Index, showed a promising slowdown in January.
> What's more, some forecasters expect the annual PCE measure to continue edging up as companies pass the cost of tariffs along to consumers. Economists at Goldman Sachs, for instance, expect core PCE to rise to 3.05%, which would be the highest since March 2024. (PCE reports are being released a month later than usual because of last year's government shutdown, and the January PCE report will be published in March.)
> Officials at the Fed will look at upcoming inflation data, especially PCE, when deciding whether to cut borrowing costs to help boost the job market or keep them higher for longer to wrestle inflation down to the 2% target.
> "With inflation well above target for going on five years in a row, policymakers will need more clarity on inflation trends before cutting rates further, especially given that some of the downside risks to the labor market seem to be receding," economists at Deutsche Bank led by Justin Weidner wrote in a commentary. "These data strengthen our view that the Fed will not be able to cut again until later this year."
> Futures Point to Lower Open for the Major Indexes
> Futures contracts connected to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were down about 0.3% in premarket trading on Thursday.
> S&P 500 futures were also off 0.3%.
> Nasdaq 100 futures contacts fell 0.4%.
> Booking Holdings. “Booking Holdings Reports Fourth Quarter 2025 Financial Results.”
> Bank of America. “Booking Holdings Inc: Price Objective Change - 4Q25 beat and reaffirmed LT growth trajectory; Buy.”
> Herbalife. "Herbalife Announces Cristiano Ronaldo Invests $7.5 Million in Pro2col™ Technology, Acquires 10% Equity Stake."

### 5. [Bernie Sanders warns about AI 'tsunami' at Stanford town hall](https://www.paloaltoonline.com/regional-politics/2026/02/21/bernie-sanders-warns-about-ai-tsunami-at-stanford-town-hall/)
**Source**: Palo Alto Online | **Date**: 2026-02-21T16:13:00+00:00

> Workers, students and researchers in Silicon Valley are no strangers to the idea that artificial intelligence may be coming for their jobs. Many are under the impression that it’s not a matter of if, but when.
> But for Sen. Bernie Sanders, an avowed skeptic of the billionaire class, the new technology has ramifications that go well beyond economics.
> “If AI is going to replace a lot of the work that human beings do, what becomes of human beings?” the Vermont senator posited to a packed auditorium at Stanford University on Friday. “Are we superfluous in the process? What happens to our ability to relate to each other?”
> Sanders and U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna, whose district is nestled in the Silicon Valley, spoke to over a thousand people at Jane Stanford Memorial Auditorium about the intersection of AI technology and the labor movement, often to uproarious applause. The town hall event, titled “Who Controls the Future of AI: The Oligarchs or The People?” was hosted by Stanford College Democrats and Stanford Speakers Bureau.
> Khanna and Sanders have both been recognized as progressive leaders in Congress. The senator was concluding his brief speaking tour of California at Stanford, just outside Khanna’s district, after the two met with technology leaders in Silicon Valley earlier in the day.
> Khanna described his district, which includes Milpitas, Sunnyvale, Cupertino and Santa Clara, as the “epicenter of wealth concentration and AI.” He said that approximately one-third of the country’s stock market is within his Congressional boundaries.
> “Tech billionaires believe they have a modern divine right to lead and rule,” Khanna told the crowd.
> Sanders, whose Senate tenure and presidential campaigns have focused on the richest “one percent” of Americans accountable for extreme wealth inequality, found a lot of common ground with Khanna when it came to standards for tech bureaucrats, too.
> But where they differed in a policy response to AI is data centers. These massive centers have cropped up throughout the country in order to meet the increasing energy requirements of AI technology. A typical AI data center can use as much electricity as 100,000 households, NPR reported, as well as billions of gallons of water to prevent the computer systems from overheating.
> Silicon Valley is one of the top host regions in the entire country for data centers, Palo Alto city staff told the Utilities Advisory Commission earlier this month.
> Sanders supports a nationwide moratorium on the growth of data centers until political leaders and the public have a better understanding of the long-term impacts of expanding AI.
> “The Congress and the American people are very unprepared for the tsunami that is coming,” Sanders said. “We have got to slow this thing down.”
> After the event, Khanna declined to support Sanders’ idea, falling back on a list of seven principles he proposed to curb the detrimental effects of artificial intelligence. He said he supports a model like the ones in Singapore and Finland, where tech companies are on the hook financially for their substantial energy use in local communities.
> Palo Alto has been grappling with the strain of data center energy use on its infrastructure, which is run locally through the city instead of through a major provider like PG&E. Santa Clara, which is in Khanna’s district, operates under a similar local electric model.
> “If there are data centers that are putting constraints on (the infrastructure), the tech companies need to pay for that. They can’t put that burden on the local community in Santa Clara or Palo Alto,” Khanna said in an interview after the event.
> Sanders and Khanna also covered topics ranging from data privacy, AI chatbots’ impact on mental health and deep fake technology, which can create convincing photos and videos of people that never happened. Political campaigns are particularly vulnerable to deep fakes — Sanders recalled being a victim of the technology himself.
> State legislators are also grappling with the problem of AI deepfakes. State Sen. Josh Becker, whose district includes Palo Alto, Menlo Park, Menlo Park and other Silicon Valley municipalities, proposed a bill earlier this week that would increase penalties for use of AI for fraud and defamation.
> But most of all, Sanders and Khanna hoped to imbue the audience with a sense of urgency about the rapidly evolving technology related to artificial intelligence. Both said they did not believe AI was inherently good or bad; Khanna described himself as an “AI democratist” rather than an accelerationist or doomer.
> Sanders compared the current state of the technology to the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, except he said the changes are coming at an exponentially faster rate. He cautioned that if workers and the general public are caught unawares, then the wealthiest individuals will continue to advance AI for one reason: the pursuit of profit.
> Even at a place like Stanford, a leading institution for AI research and advancement, his comments received thunderous applause.
> “We are looking at the most significant investment in human history, which is bringing about the most rapid societal transformation in human history,” Sanders said.
