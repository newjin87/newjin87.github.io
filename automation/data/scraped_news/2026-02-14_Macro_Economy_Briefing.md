### 1. [US inflation slows to 2.4% in January. What it means for interest rates.](https://www.dispatch.com/story/money/2026/02/13/us-january-inflation-report-cpi/88589798007/)
**Source**: The Columbus Dispatch | **Date**: 2026-02-14T05:51:00+00:00

> Inflation cooled a bit more than forecasters expected in January, with prices rising 2.4% from a year earlier, the Labor Department said Feb. 13.
> The report, which was delayed two days due to a brief government shutdown, revealed inflation fell in the first month of 2026 after holding steady at 2.7% in December. The slightly lower number for January reflects smaller price increases for shelter and food, as well as a decrease in the index for energy, which fell 1.5%.
> Prices are still rising, but inflation remains well below the pace seen in 2022, and far from the rate consumers and businesses expected after President Donald Trump imposed broad tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners last year. Still, in a New York Times and Siena University poll released Jan. 22, Americans ranked the economy as their top concern, and 51% said the president’s policies have made their lives less affordable.
> Oxford Economics Lead Economist Bernard Yaros said the January Consumer Price Index delivered "a welcome surprise" to start the year.
> "In recent years, residual seasonality, along with delayed price adjustments in response to pandemic-era shocks, have led to upside CPI surprises in January," Yaros said in a note following the report's release. "These were no longer on full display this time around, further reinforcing our view (that) tariff-induced price increases on the goods side are largely behind us."
> On a monthly basis, prices increased 0.2%, down from 0.3% in December. Prices for airline fares, personal care, recreation, and medical care increased over the month. Meanwhile, the cost of used cars and trucks, household furnishings and operations, and motor vehicle insurance declined.
> Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.3% in January. The rate of core inflation over the last 12 months, however, fell to 2.5% over the last 12 months, its lowest reading since 2021, and down from 2.6% the month before.
> "Yes, a 0.30% monthly increase in core CPI is an annual run rate well north of the Fed's 2% inflation target, so victory over inflation is not yet upon us," Wells Fargo economists said in a research note, adding there are still reasons to be optimistic. "...Tariff-induced price hikes probably have not fully worked their way through the data, but we are closer to the end than the beginning of this source of higher prices."
> The food at home index increased 0.2%, down from a 0.7% increase in December, meaning grocery prices still rose in January but at a slower pace than they did in the last month of 2025.
> Cereal and bakery product costs rose by 1.2% in January. The dairy and related products index rose 0.8%, and the index for meat, poultry, fish, and eggs rose 0.2%. Nonalcoholic beverages, fruits, and vegetables also got more expensive, rising 0.1%.
> Seasonally adjusted gasoline prices fell 3.2% in January and are down 7.5% over the year. Regular unleaded averaged $2.94 per gallon Feb. 13, up from about $2.82 last month, and down from $3.16 last year, according to AAA.
> On the other hand, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said the index for electricity has increased 6.3% over the last 12 months while the natural gas index rose 9.8% over the same period.
> Days after a better-than-expected jobs report revealed U.S. employers added 130,000 jobs and the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.3%, Yaros said the January CPI is more welcome news for Federal Reserve policymakers.
> “But we aren’t changing the baseline forecast for monetary policy based on one inflation reading,” Yaros said in the note. “Lingering distortions from the shutdown in the price data, prospects for solid growth this year, and a stabilizing job market will keep the central bank on hold until June.”
> BlackRock Chief Investment and Portfolio Strategist for the Americas Gargi Chaudhuri said policymakers are likely to hold the Fed's benchmark interest rate steady, with markets not pricing in another cut until the summer.
> “Better growth outcomes and some signs of labor market stabilization allow policymakers time to assess incoming data, while renewed labor market weakening would likely prompt cuts, we expect labor conditions to remain broadly stable,” Chaudhuri said in a separate note, adding a caveat that Trump’s recent nomination of Kevin Warsh to lead the Fed could change the way the central bank responds to data.
> As of Feb. 13, Fed watchers predict policymakers will hold the federal funds rate steady at a range of 3.5% to 3.75% at their next meeting in March.

### 2. [Trump ramps up Fed rate cut pressure after strong jobs, inflation reports](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-ramps-fed-rate-cut-110000889.html)
**Source**: Yahoo Finance | **Date**: 2026-02-14T13:42:00+00:00

> President Trump and top White House officials are ramping up pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates after two surprisingly strong economic reports.
> Data released by the Labor Department on Friday showed inflation falling below economist expectations in January, two days after the January jobs report showed a surprising surge in hiring last month.
> The double dose of good economic news was sorely needed for Trump and Republicans, who have faced backlash over the state of the job market and inflation for more than a year.
> “We’ve brought costs way down, and the numbers were surprising — except to me, they weren’t surprising,” Trump said Friday at the White House.
> “The inflation numbers are way down. We brought it back on track,” he continued.
> Trump administration officials are now arguing that the combination of better-than-expected job gains and inflation should convince the Fed to heed the president’s call for lower interest rates.
> “With inflation now low and stable, America’s economy is set to turbocharge even further through long-overdue interest rate cuts from the Fed,” White House deputy press secretary Kush Desai said in a statement following the consumer price index (CPI) report.
> Fed officials are expecting to cut interest rates twice this year, according to projections released in December, and the new inflation data could help make the case for additional reductions.
> “The Fed’s path to ‘normalization’ cuts appears clearer now with fears of a strong January print behind us with CPI coming in cold,” said Lindsay Rosner, head of multisector fixed income investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.
> But those cuts may not come until well after the Fed’s next policy meeting in March, experts say, risking another blowup between Trump and Fed Chair Jerome Powell.
> “How short or long that path is however will depend on whether employment continues to show signs of improvement, given the [Fed’s] sensitivity to labor market weakness.”
> The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the panel of Fed officials responsible for setting monetary policy, cut interest rates three times in 2025 as the job market sputtered during Trump’s first term and inflation bounced around its 2.6 percent annual level in November 2024.
> At the time, Powell and Fed officials were attempting to balance the threats of deeper job losses — which usually prompt rate cuts — and higher inflation, which usually prompts rate hikes.
> The Fed’s careful approach drew fury from Trump and White House officials, who had insisted inflation was under control and accused Powell of needlessly choking out the economy.
> Two weeks after the Fed delivered its third consecutive rate cut of the year, the Justice Department announced a criminal probe into the Fed and Powell’s handling of renovations to its headquarters.
> Powell — along with scores of Fed alumni, lawmakers, economists and analysts — denounced the probe as a thinly veiled effort to pressure the bank into deeper rate cuts.
> The Fed then held rates steady at its most recent meeting in January, voting 10-2 to keep its baseline interest rate range between 3.5 percent and 3.75 percent.
> In a press conference following the Fed’s decision, Powell said that he and his colleagues thought it was “appropriate” to leave rates alone. The job market appeared to be “stabilizing” after a period of rising unemployment, he said, and inflation had remained well above the Fed’s target of 2 percent annual price growth.
> “The economy is growing at a solid pace, the unemployment rate has been broadly stable, and inflation remains somewhat elevated. So we’ll be looking to our goal variables and letting the data light the way for us,” Powell said.
> The January data released this week showed early signs of those trends reversing in 2026, with the U.S. gaining 130,000 jobs last month and the annual inflation rate dropping to 2.5 percent, according to the consumer price index.
> “The United States of America should be paying MUCH LESS on its Borrowings (BONDS!). We are again the strongest Country in the World, and should therefore be paying the LOWEST INTEREST RATE, by far,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post touting the jobs report Wednesday.
> Rosner said she and her team are still expecting the Fed to cut rates twice this year, with the first coming in June. Investors broadly see the Fed sticking to this schedule, according to the CME Group FedWatch tool, which tracks bets placed on future Fed interest rate moves.
> Traders see a 90.2 percent chance the Fed holds rates steady at its next meeting in March and 69.7 percent chance of no cut in April, but a 68.9 percent chance of a cut in June, according to FedWatch.
> If those expectations hold, the Fed’s first cut wouldn’t come until the end of Powell’s term as Fed chair, which expires in May.
> Trump nominated former Fed board member Kevin Warsh to replace Powell last month, and his Senate confirmation could help lead the bank to the deeper cuts the president is seeking.
> “Warsh appears to prefer a return to a more forward-looking approach, based on the idea that the economy has entered a structural acceleration in the rate of potential economic growth, fueled by AI, among other factors,” explained Michael Pearce, deputy chief economist at Oxford Economics.
> “There’s already support for that idea on the policy committee, with Governor Christopher Waller, who was in the running for the chair, expressing similar views.”
> Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, made a similar argument Wednesday after the January jobs surprise. Instead of seeing higher job growth as a reason to keep rates higher, Hassett said, the Fed should embrace the chance to add more fuel to a potential economic boom driven by AI.
> “Right now, we’ve got high growth and low inflation. And I think there’s plenty of room for the Fed to cut rates,” Hassett said in an interview on Fox Business Network.
> “This theory — about why you would lift rates right now because of high growth — is an old fashioned Phillips Curve story that doesn’t really apply when you get a big, positive supply shock from AI or the internet,” he continued, referring to the traditional economic model in which inflation and unemployment work in opposite directions.
> Even so, putting additional pressure on Powell to deliver lower rates could end up delaying Warsh’s opportunity to do so.
> Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), who is retiring after 2026, has vowed to block all Trump Fed nominees until the Justice Department resolves its criminal investigation into the central bank.
> As a member of the Senate Banking Committee, Tillis could also deadlock the panel’s vote to advance Warsh’s nomination, assuming all Democrats hold the line against Trump’s pick.
> Tillis said Friday that he will continue to hold the line against Warsh, whom he would otherwise support, and rebuffed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s suggestion to shift the Powell probe to the Senate Banking Commitee, which is responsible for Fed oversight.
> “I don’t think it’s an off-ramp, I think it’s a suggestion for good governance. I don’t think we do enough oversight on how our plans work out in terms of cost of time,” Tillis said of Bessent’s offer.
> “It doesn’t change my posture,” he said.

### 3. [Gold and silver rate today LIVE: Silver, gold prices rebound as US Dollar weakens after better-than-expected US CPI data](https://www.livemint.com/market/commodities/gold-and-silver-rate-today-live-gold-silver-prices-remain-lower-more-pain-ahead-11770900951169.html)
**Source**: Mint | **Date**: 2026-02-14T02:35:00+00:00

> Gold and silver rate today LIVE: Gold and silver prices bounced back strongly on Friday after the softer-than-expected US CPI data. Defying the market expectations of 2.50%, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported the US CPI inflation of 2.40% in January 2026, putting the US Dollar (USD) under pressure. However, this is 0.30% higher than the December 2025 CPI inflation. This triggered buying in the precious metals. The COMEX gold rate finished at $5,046.30/oz, logging an intraday gain of around 2%. The MCX gold rate ended at  ₹1,56,200 per 10 gm, around  ₹24,500 below the record high of  ₹1,80,779 per 10 gm.
> Likewise, the COMEX silver price finished at $77.964/oz, logging an intraday gain of over 3%. The MCX silver rate ended at  ₹2,44,999 per kg, around  ₹1,75,000 below the record high of  ₹4,20,048 per kg.
> Currently, gold prices on the MCX hover in a tight range of around  ₹1,50,000 to  ₹1,58,000. And silver MCX futures are trading near the  ₹2,35,000 –  ₹2,70,000 zone.
> Recent corrections have wiped out a large portion of earlier gains, yet analysts see the pullbacks as opportunities within what many view as an extended multi‑year bull market for precious metals.
> Domestic brokerage Emkay Wealth recently opined that gold and silver are in a 3-5 year bull run, supported by favourable macroeconomic conditions, structural demand trends, and shifting investor preferences.
> Emkay Wealth recommended that the existing investors continue holding gold and silver as part of a diversified portfolio. Any incremental additions should be made gradually and preferably during periods of correction, it is advised.
> The US CPI data reported on Friday night signals a rise in US inflation, which is expected to put the US Dollar Index under pressure. So, gold and silver prices are expected to open higher on Monday.
> — Anuj Gupta, a SEBI-registered market expert
> The Bureau of Labour Statistics reported US CPI inflation for January 2026 at 2.40%, which is better than the expected 2.50%. However, it is 0.30% higher than the December 2025 US CPI inflation.
> Underlying US inflation accelerated slightly at the start of the year, in line with expectations, as a pickup in services costs more than offset stable goods prices.
> The core consumer price index, which excludes often-volatile food and energy costs, increased 0.3% from December, the most since August, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data out Friday. At the same time, the core CPI rose from a year ago by the least since 2021.
> The slight pickup in inflation reflected higher prices for airline fares, personal care, recreation, medical care and communication. However, prices of used cars and trucks, household furnishings and auto insurance decreased last month.
> Watch this space for LIVE updates in gold and silver prices.
> A sustained move above  ₹1,60,000 would likely re-ignite bullish momentum toward  ₹1,65,000– ₹1,70,000+, while meaningful downside risk remains limited unless COMEX gold breaches its structural support clusters decisively.
> — Ponmudi R, CEO at Enrich Money
> MCX Gold continues to exhibit structural resilience despite global consolidation, supported by relative firmness in USD/INR. The  ₹1,50,000 support band remains a strong demand absorption zone, attracting both physical buying and investment flows, reinforcing the integrity of the medium-term rising channel. Price behavior at lower levels indicates accumulation rather than distribution.
> — Ponmudi R, CEO at Enrich Money
> As long as gold sustains above $4,900 on a closing basis, the bias remains constructive, with recovery potential toward $5,150–$5,350 on renewed safe-haven demand or incremental USD softness. Downside risks would meaningfully increase only upon a decisive violation of the $4,600 structural base.
> — Ponmudi R, CEO at Enrich Money
> COMEX Gold continues to consolidate above the $5,000 zone, successfully defending the structural demand base formed after last week’s aggressive liquidation. The broader multi-year rising channel remains intact, with the $4,500–$4,600 breakout cluster acting as a key long-term support region. Current price compression suggests energy build-up rather than structural weakness.
> — Ponmudi R, CEO at Enrich  Money
> After the release of the US CPI data, US Dollar Index witnessed profit-booking, which triggered buying in the precious metals. The trend is expected to continue on Monday. We are expecting pressure for US Dollar when the FOREX market opens on Monday. Likewise gold and silver prices are expected to maintain sideways to positive bias.
> — Anuj Gupta, a SEBI-registered market experts
> The US CPI data reported on Friday night signals a rise in US inflation, which is expected to put the US Dollar Index under pressure. So, gold and silver prices are expected to open higher on Monday.
> — Anuj Gupta, a SEBI-registered market expert
> With central banks continuing to accumulate gold, interest rate cycles turning supportive, and silver benefiting from rising industrial demand, precious metals are increasingly being viewed as core portfolio assets rather than tactical hedges.
> Over 15 years, equities returned 12.1%, while over 10 years, returns stood at 14.2%. These figures reinforce why equities remain the core of long-term portfolios despite periodic volatility.
> Meanwhile, gold, even over 15 years, gold returned 14.4%, whereas over 10 years it delivered 19.7% CAGR. These numbers underline gold’s dual role as both a hedge and a long-term wealth creator, especially during periods of economic uncertainty.
> Indian equities, measured by the Nifty 50 TRI, delivered compounded annualised returns of 12.6% over 20 years, translating into a 10.7x return on invested capital.
> However, over 20 years, the yellow metal has delivered a compounded annual return of 15.6%, the highest among all asset classes, and multiplied investments by a remarkable 18.3 times.
> Long-term investing data once again highlighted a key finding - Gold returns have outperformed the Indian stock market index Nifty and other asset classes, including fixed income, real estate, in the long as well as short term.
> A comparison of returns across equities, gold, real estate and debt as of January 31, 2026 by FundsIndia’s Wealth Conversations Report shows that while equities have consistently delivered solid wealth creation, gold has emerged as the top-performing asset over the longest periods.
> Better-than-expected U.S. jobs data dampened expectations of more aggressive rate cuts, triggering a risk-off sentiment across global markets during the week. However, a softer-than-anticipated U.S. inflation print released on Friday has left investors divided over the future trajectory of monetary easing.
> — Ponmudi R, CEO at Enrich Money
> Gold has recovered post the Jan-end collapse and is well on its way to what we believe should be 6000 USD/Oz levels by the end of CY 2026. Though President Trump’s deal with India, a potential deal with Brazil, etc., has reduced uncertainty, higher inflation, as well as continuing geopolitical uncertainties, apart from the emerging split between the North West and the rest of the world, will continue to propel the Reserve Bank's buying. We believe all dips are an opportunity to buy Gold.
> — Sandip Raichura, CEO — Retail Broking at PL Capital
> On Friday, the Nifty 50 index finished at 25,471, whereas the MCX gold rate ended at  ₹15,220 per gm. Hence, the Nifty 50-Gold ratio comes around 1.63. As we know, if the Nifty-Gold ratio dips below 2.50, the chances of equity outperforming the precious metal increase. Hence, for those who believe in bottom-fishing in the current market scenario, the Nifty-gold ratio signals higher returns in equities.
> — Anuj Gupta, a SEBI-registered market expert
> The U.S. Labor Department on Wednesday (local time) reported strong jobs data for January 2026, with employers adding 130,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate declining to 4.3%, Bloomberg reported.
> The data released shows a strong start to 2026 as compared to the slowed growth witnessed in the previous year, when job gains averaged just 15,000 a month, down from the initially reported 49,000 pace. The Bureau of Labor Statistics report also suggests that the market is finding its footing after witnessing a year marked by rising unemployment and minimal hiring.
> The Bureau of Labour Statistics also incorporated new seasonal adjustment factors, with the previous five years’ data subject to revision. The agency also adjusts the relative importance of the individual price categories that make up the CPI.
> Alongside recent indications of a stabilizing labor market, Federal Reserve officials will likely want to see further inflation progress before lowering interest rates. Traders see roughly even odds the central bank will next lower borrowing costs at their June meeting after three straight cuts in late 2025.
> The Bureau of Labour Statistics reported US CPI inflation for January 2026 at 2.40%, which is better than the expected 2.50%.
> Underlying US inflation accelerated slightly at the start of the year, in line with expectations, as a pickup in services costs more than offset stable goods prices.
> The core consumer price index, which excludes often-volatile food and energy costs, increased 0.3% from December, the most since August, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data out Friday. At the same time the core CPI rose from a year ago by the least since 2021.
> The slight pickup in inflation reflected higher prices for airline fares, personal care, recreation, medical care and communication. However, prices of used cars and trucks, household furnishings and auto insurance decreased last month.
> Indian equities, measured by the Nifty 50 TRI, delivered compounded annualised returns of 12.6% over 20 years, translating into a 10.7x return on invested capital.
> However, over 20 years, the yellow metal has delivered a compounded annual return of 15.6%, the highest among all asset classes, and multiplied investments by a remarkable 18.3 times.
> A comparison of returns across equities, gold, real estate and debt as of January 31, 2026 by FundsIndia’s Wealth Conversations Report shows that while equities have consistently delivered solid wealth creation, gold has emerged as the top-performing asset over the longest periods.
> Silver faced additional pressure from weak U.S. existing home sales and concerns over softer Chinese industrial demand ahead of the Lunar New Year shutdown.
> — Kaynat Chainwala, AVP Commodity Research at Kotak Securities
> Today, silver has rebounded 5% to trade near $79/oz, and gold has also recovered to $4,990/oz as markets turn their focus to upcoming U.S. CPI data. Softer inflation readings could revive expectations of policy easing and provide much-needed stability to bullion prices, while persistent inflation and a resilient labour market could keep the Fed on a “higher-for-longer” trajectory, keeping prices under pressure. An extended rout in U.S. technology stocks remains an additional downside risk.
> — Kaynat Chainwala, AVP Commodity Research at Kotak Securities
> Extending the morning gains, the MCX gold rate today is above  ₹1,55,000 per 10 gm, logging an intraday gain of around 1.75%. Likewise, the MCX silver rate today is trading around  ₹2,45,000 per kg, delivering an intraday gain of over  ₹8,000 per kg.
> Extending the morning gains in the later phase of the Friday session, the COMEX gold rate today is trading around $5,040/oz,  recording an intraday gain of around 1.80%.
> Likewise, the COMEX silver rate today is trading above $78/oz, showing an intraday gain of over 3%.
> Gold traded positively in the early session, but the overall tone remains volatile to weak after yesterday’s sharp sell-off from  ₹1,58,000 to  ₹1,54,000, as prices failed to sustain above the  ₹1,60,000 mark. Resistance is now firmly placed near  ₹1,60,000, and if gold continues to trade below  ₹1,56,000, a retest of the  ₹1,51,000 support zone cannot be ruled out.
> — Jateen Trivedi, VP Research — Commodity & Currency at LKP Securities
> In the near term, trading may remain two‑way as markets digest US policy signals and risk events. However, dips are likely to attract buyers, supported by resilient safe‑haven demand and slowing real yields. Overall, while short‑term consolidation or pullbacks are possible, the long‑term trajectory remains upward, not indicative of a major correction.
> — Hareesh V, Head of Commodity Research at Geojit Investments
> Gold prices have turned choppy following their sharp swings in early 2026, but the broader structure still appears constructive. Recent volatility was driven by shifts in Fed expectations, dollar strength, and speculative flows, yet gold continues to hold above key psychological levels near $5,000, keeping the medium‑term bias intact. Most institutional forecasts also support a positive long‑term narrative for 2026, underpinned by strong central‑bank buying, geopolitical uncertainty, and a softer dollar outlook.
> — Hareesh V, Head of Commodity Research, Geojit Investments
> Easing geopolitical tensions, particularly around Russia-Ukraine and renewed U.S.-Iran nuclear discussions, dampened safe-haven demand. Silver faced additional pressure from weak U.S. existing home sales and concerns over softer Chinese industrial demand ahead of the Lunar New Year shutdown. Today, silver has rebounded 5% to trade near $79/oz, and Gold has also recovered to $4,990/oz as markets turn their focus to upcoming U.S. CPI data. Softer inflation readings could revive expectations of policy easing and provide much-needed stability to bullion prices, while persistent inflation and a resilient labour market could keep the Fed on a “higher-for-longer” trajectory, keeping prices under pressure. An extended rout in U.S. technology stocks remains an additional downside risk.
> — Kaynat Chainwala, AVP — Commodity Research at Kotak Securities
> Gold and silver retreated sharply on Thursday, with spot gold falling more than 3% to $4,920/oz and silver plunging 10% to $75/oz, driven by renewed weakness in U.S. technology stocks and shifting expectations around Federal Reserve policy following firmer U.S. labor data. U.S. jobless claims declined to 227,000 in the week ending February 7, down from 232,000 previously, while the four-week average held steady near 219,500. Together with the recent strong nonfarm payrolls report, the data reinforced expectations that the Fed will maintain a steady policy stance. Reduced bets on a July rate cut outweighed the impact of softer Treasury yields.
> — Kaynat Chainwala, AVP — Commodity Research at Kotak Securities
> Strong buying interest is visible in the $65–$70 support band, aligned with prior swing lows and long-term trend support. A sustained hold above this base, followed by a recovery and close above $85–$92, could revive upside momentum toward $95–$105 and potentially retest previous highs. The medium- to long-term outlook remains constructive, supported by steady industrial demand and structural supply constraints, despite elevated volatility.
> COMEX Silver is trading near the $73–$84 zone after a sharp correction from record highs above $121. While the broader bullish structure remains intact on higher timeframes, the steep pullback has pushed prices below key moving averages, indicating short-term bearish pressure and an extended corrective phase.
> — Ponmudi R, CEO at Enrich Money
> Strong buying interest is seen in the  ₹1,45,000 to  ₹1,50,000 support area. A sustained hold above this base, followed by a breakout above  ₹1,60,800, could revive upside momentum toward  ₹1,65,000 to  ₹1,75,000, keeping the medium-term outlook positive despite ongoing volatility.
> — Ponmudi R, CEO at Enrich Money
> MCX Gold futures are trading near the  ₹1,50,000 to  ₹1,60,000 zone, following consolidation after the sharp correction from all-time highs around  ₹1,80,000 to  ₹1,81,000. While prices are currently consolidating near current levels in the short term, the broader uptrend remains supportive, with prices holding above important long-term support zones.
> — Ponmudi R, CEO at Enrich Money
> Gold has recovered post the January 2026 end-collapse and is well on its way to what we believe should be $6000/Oz levels by the end of CY 2026. Though President Trump’s deal with India, a potential deal with Brazil, etc., has reduced uncertainty, higher inflation, as well as continuing geopolitical uncertainties, apart from the emerging split between the North West and the rest of the world, will continue to propel the Reserve Bank's buying. We believe all dips are an opportunity to buy Gold.
> — Sandip Raichura, CEO of Retail Broking at PL Capital
> COMEX Gold is trading near the $4,850–$5,100 zone after a sharp correction from recent highs above $5,500–$5,600. The broader uptrend remains intact, with the recent pullback reflecting profit booking and healthy price digestion. Prices are currently consolidating in the short term near current levels, trading above key moving averages, suggesting the correction is maturing.
> — Ponmudi R, CEO at Enrich Money
> The spike in retail inflation in January 2026 is mainly due to the rise in food prices, along with changes in components, with 2023-24 as the base. Technically, it is a good sign that, despite the changes, the inflationary trend has remained well within the RBI's comfort band.
> This will help sustain household purchasing power and confidence, supporting continued spending on essential and discretionary goods alike, keeping the pricing dynamics balanced. While this can be taken positively, it is critical to be watchful of how the situation unfolds as we move further into 2026, especially amid economic volatility driven by global headwinds.
> — Sanjay Kumar, CEO & MD, Rassense
> Strong buying interest is visible in the $4,500–$4,700 support band, and sustained stability above this zone could set the stage for renewed upside momentum. A breakout above $5,200–$5,300 would open the path toward a retest of record highs.
> — Ponmudi R, CEO at Enrich Money
> The MCX silver rate today has supports placed at $74 and $71 per ounce, whereas the precious white metal is facing resistance at $78 and $80 per ounce.
> In India, the MCX silver rate today has resistance at  ₹2,48,000 and  ₹2,56,000 per kg, with supports at  ₹2,30,000 and  ₹2,24,000 per kg.
> — Anuj Gupyta, a SEBI-registered market expert.
> The support for the COMEX gold rate today is placed at $4,940 to $4,910 per ounce, while the precious yellow metal is facing a hurdle at $5,020 to $5,070 per ounce.
> In India, the MCX gold price today is supported at  ₹1,50,500 to  ₹1,49,000 per 10 gm, whereas the yellow metal futures for the April 2026 expiry are facing resistance at  ₹1,55,000 and  ₹1,58,000 per 10 gm range.
> — Anuj Gupta, a SEBI-registered market expert

### 4. [XRP News Today: ETF Inflows and CPI Spark Rebound, $1.5 in Play](https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/xrp-news-today-etf-inflows-and-cpi-spark-rebound-1-5-in-play-1579572)
**Source**: FX Empire | **Date**: 2026-02-14T04:34:00+00:00

> XRP snaps its three-day losing streak on strong demand for XRP-spot ETFs and a softer US CPI report.
> On Friday, February 13, US headline inflation came in softer than expected, raising expectations of a June Fed rate cut. The prospect of lower borrowing rates sent XRP to a session high, underscoring sensitivity to the Fed rate path.
> Meanwhile, the US XRP-spot ETF market saw net inflows for a second consecutive week, signaling robust institutional demand for the token.
> While XRP’s February losses support a bearish short-term outlook, the medium-term outlook remains bullish.
> Below, I will explore the key drivers behind recent price trends, the medium-term (4-8 weeks) outlook, and the technical levels traders should watch.
> On February 13, the highly anticipated US CPI report fueled demand for risk assets. The annual inflation rate eased from 2.7% in December to 2.4% in January. Economists expected headline inflation to come in at 2.5%. Meanwhile, core inflation fell from 2.6% in December to 2.5% in January, aligned with consensus.
> While holding above the Fed’s 2% target, cooling inflation lifted expectations of a June Fed rate cut. Typically, lower borrowing costs boost liquidity, fueling speculative and leveraged positioning in XRP.
> According to the CME FedWatch Tool, the chances of a June Fed rate cut rose from 62.3% on February 12 to 68.7% on February 13, indicating a shift in market sentiment toward a more dovish Fed policy outlook. XRP rallied from $1.3741 to a session high of $1.4270 in response. Increased expectations of lower interest rates support the bullish medium-term (4-8 weeks) and longer-term (8-12 weeks) outlook for XRP.
> Friday’s US inflation figures revived demand for US XRP-spot ETFs, another crucial price catalyst. The US XRP-spot ETF market saw total net inflows of $4.5 million on February 13, partially reversing the previous day’s outflows of $6.42 million. Friday’s inflows contributed to $7.65 million of net inflows in the reporting week ending February 13, tilting the supply-demand balance in XRP’s favor.
> Despite snapping a three-day losing streak, XRP has plunged 14% in February. February’s pullback affirms a negative short-term outlook (1-4 weeks), with a target price of $1.0.
> However, robust institutional demand for XRP-spot ETFs, optimism over the US Senate passing the Market Structure Bill, and increased XRP utility reinforce the bullish medium- to long-term price projections:
> Several events could derail the constructive medium-term bias. These include:
> These scenarios would weigh on XRP, pushing the token toward $1.0, reaffirming the bearish short-term outlook.
> XRP rallied 3.62% on February 13, reversing the previous day’s 0.52%, closing at $1.4071. The token tracked the broader crypto market cap, which advanced by 3.52%.
> Despite reclaiming $1.4, XRP remained well below its 50-day and 200-day EMAs, signaling bearish momentum. Notably, the 50-day EMA steepened its downward trajectory, also a bearish indicator. However, several positive fundamentals continue to counter bearish technicals, supporting the bullish medium-term outlook. Nevertheless, short-term technicals remain bearish despite improving fundamentals.
> Key technical levels to watch include:
> On the daily chart, a breakout above $1.50 would bring the 50-day EMA into play. A sustained move through the 50-day EMA would signal a near-term bullish trend reversal. A bullish trend reversal would open the door to testing the 200-day EMA.
> A sustained break above the EMAs would reaffirm a bullish trend reversal and the medium- to longer-term price targets.
> Near-term price drivers include:
> XRP’s February pullback affirmed the existing bearish trend. A drop below the lower trendline would expose the February 6 low of $1.1227. If breached, $1.0 would be the next key support level. A sustained fall through $1.0 would reaffirm the bearish short-term outlook and further validate the bearish structure.
> However, a breakout above $1.5 would enable the bulls to target $2.0 and the upper trendline. A sustained move through the upper trendline would invalidate the bearish structure and signal a bullish trend reversal, reinforcing the constructive medium-term bias.
> Looking ahead, regulatory developments on Capitol Hill remain critical to XRP’s price trajectory. An end to the TradFi-DeFi stalemate on stablecoin yields would boost hopes that the Senate will pass the Market Structure Bill, driving XRP demand.
> Meanwhile, the upcoming FOMC meeting minutes, central bank rhetoric, and XRP-spot ETF flows will also dictate buying interest in XRP.
> A more dovish Fed rate path and a dovish BoJ neutral rate (potentially 1%-1.25%) would lift sentiment. Sustained demand for US XRP-spot ETFs and the progress of the Market Structure Bill would reaffirm the positive medium-term outlook.
> In summary, these events support a medium-term (4–8 weeks) move to $2.5. The US Senate passing the Market Structure Bill would reinforce the longer-term (8-12 weeks) price target of $3.0.
> Beyond 12 weeks, these factors are likely to drive XRP to its all-time high of $3.66 (Binance). A breakout above $3.66 would reaffirm a 6- to 12-month price target of $5.

> The International Energy Agency trimmed its forecast for global oil demand growth in 2026 by another 83,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 849,000 bpd. Global supply is expected to grow by 2.4 million bpd. The US Energy Information Administration says the growing supply surplus will push down the average Brent crude price from $69 per barrel in 2025 to $58 in 2026 and $53 in 2027.
> China's inflation grew less than forecast by 0.2% year-on-year in January, down from a gain of 0.8% in December, as food prices fell sharply. Producer prices fell 1.4% year-on-year, in line with forecasts.

> Caretaker Finance Minister Ekniti Nitithanprapas said the Quick Big Win projects such as Half-Half Plus and tourism stimulus were expected to help lift fourth-quarter GDP growth to 1.8%, versus earlier market forecasts of 0.3%.

> The World Bank lowered its 2026 Thailand GDP growth forecast to 1.6% from 1.8%, citing a global trade slowdown, high household debt and a sluggish tourism recovery. Growth is expected to accelerate to 2.2% in 2027, as foreign direct investment pledges materialise as actual private investment.

> ECONOMIC TIMETABLES FOR FEBRUARY 2026 – Will signs of recovery in Europe last? Will Italian growth shake off the "point zero" curse? Will low consumer confidence in America lead to a slowdown in consumption? When will the Fed lower rates? Will the ECB hold them at 2%? Will the rise in long-term rates continue? Does the BTP/Bund spread still have room to narrow? Has the dollar truly lost its historic role as a reserve currency? Is stock market optimism excessive? Why have non-US stock markets performed better than Wall Street? Will gold rise further? Will Bitcoin fall further?
> It's really waking up Sleeping Beauty in the Woods? The beauty is theeconomy of the eurozone and the forest is much thicker, darker, and full of dangers than the one in the fairy tale of the same name. Between geopolitical tensions, the arms race, the reshaping of globalization through tariffs and counter-tariffs, the AI ​​revolution, demographic glaciation, and the race for renewable energy, there are more thorns and sharper that among the impenetrable brambles that surround the enchanted castle. In fact, in many ways the context refers to the original version of the fairy tale of the same name, that of Giambattista Basile, rather than the sweetened plot of Charles Perrault.
> However, we can see a glimpse of a European economic revival. There are encouraging signs. Strong and weak signalsAmong the strong was theunexpected increase (to the extent) of GDP in the last quarter of 2025: +0,3% in the Eurozone (+0,4% net of the Irish decline, due to the invoicing policies of large multinationals with registered offices in Ireland). Furthermore, the unemployment has started to fall again, equaling the low of thirteen months earlier last December. Finally, the orders to German industry They're back on track, especially the large ones, which at the end of 25 climbed back to the levels of four years ago; the others are still 13 percentage points below.
> The trend in GDP in the period from the pandemic onwards reveals, if compared with two previous sub-periods (i.e. end of '99-end of '07 and end of '14-end of '19) that at the heart of European weakness is the German crisis; Germany's economic dynamics has almost collapsed, with variations visible only to the second decimal place (0,02% quarterly average), against the previous 0,4-0,5%. That crisis is based on theautomotive: the transition to electric has generated a wave of the famous Fear Teutonic at the top of the major German automotive causes, which are struggling to get out of the ford between internal combustion and EV. Furthermore, the energy intensive industries, another pillar of German industry; and the loss of output from these industries (-20% since the end of 2021) is likely to be permanent.
> Fortunately, Germany understood a year ago the need to change the model and focus on domestic demand driven by public investments in infrastructure (including schools and hospitals) and armaments. Now that shift is starting to translate into spending and in fact to pull they are the internal orders.
> Compared to the German trend, theItaly from a tortoise it seems to have transformed into a hare. So much so that some people speak of change of pace. In reality, as we have seen, compared to both of the two previous sub-periods, the one that changed pace (backwards, however) was the rest of Europe,: from +0,6% and +0,5% to +0,3%, against +0,4%, +0,2% and +0,3% in Italy. Without the superbonus and public investments from PNRR Italian GDP would have increased as in the previous period, and perhaps less. It's true that exports and non-construction investments performed well, but the former were due to the two interrelated compressions of domestic demand and real wages, and those investments are visible everywhere except in productivity, to paraphrase Robert Solow. Finally, in Italy, the PNRR is nearing its end, but the government will avoid a collapse in public capital spending, following the guidelines indicated in the DFP (Public Finance Document) last April.
> Among the weak signals that suggest that the European economic awakening is underway, the composite confidence of businesses and consumers, which rose to a three-year high in January, albeit with notable differences between countries, differences that reflect the different dynamics: Spain in the leadGermany trailing but rising sharply from year-ago lows.
> Outside Europe, indicators for the beginning of 2026 (PMI in January) point to good, stable weather in Asia, where activity is improving in India, Japan and, to a lesser extent, China, and progress is being recorded in almost all other economies in the area or neighboring ones (South Korea, Australia, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Taiwan), confirming a collective momentum that reinforces each other; in fact, it is the only area where exports have started to increase again.
> …while American employment starts growing again
> In USA there was a sudden brake on the retail sales in December, despite Christmas shopping appearing to have gone well. In fact, the consumers continue to be concerned about the shortage of new jobs and the nest egg of the accumulated savings during the pandemic it more than halved and its reduction has accelerated in recent months because the real wage bill remained unchanged for a long time during 2025. However, in the tug of war between a brilliant increase in domestic final demand and a weak employment situation, the former is winning: the creation of jobs in the private sector It reached its lowest point in August and in January it reached +103 thousand (three-month moving average).
> THEinflation continues to fall, in different sizes and on both sides of the Atlantic and in Japan. While it has risen again in China leaving behind deflation (negative price variations), a symptom of weak demand and excess production capacity, and difficult for monetary policy to manage.
> La Japanese inflection The annual change in consumer prices from 2,9% in November to 2,1% in December was "manipulated" by the introduction of new and higher energy subsidies. In fact, the annual change in consumer prices remained unchanged. core, which does not include energy and fresh food, at 3,0%; in January in the Tokyo area (a good predictor of the national trend) fell to 2,4% from 2,7% in December. So is the return to a more physiological trend in Japanese prices proving ephemeral this time too? A negative answer to hear the businesses, with manufacturers saying they have increased price lists in January at the highest rate in over a year and a half and with those of services they applied the highest increases in seven months.
> In 'Euro area the annual change in consumer prices went from 2,1% in November to 1,9% in December to 1,7% in January. The decline in core is less pronounced: from 2,4% in three months to 2,2% last year, while in services it went from 3,5% to 3,2%. On the other hand, it is normal that in the tertiary sector prices remain warmer, because productivity gains are lower. Some forecast a further decline in annual inflation, based on the strong increases recorded in the first half of 2025, but even these analysts agree that the core inflation will remain around or above 2% and that the services sector is slowing down together with wages.
> These disinflationary performances are, after all, ordinary, given the trend in the determinants of input costs (see below). Instead, the cooling of consumer prices observed in the United States, who seem to have ignored the sudden and widespread increase in import dutiesIndeed, the annual rate of change increased slightly from 2,3% in March 2025 (the month before the new tariffs were announced) to 3,0% in October, then dropped to 2,4% in January 2026, but only slightly compared to the fears and forecasts that saw it at 5%. It can also be correctly argued that without the tariff increase, it would have fallen earlier to within the Fed's target (2,0%), or even below, paving the way for faster and more decisive interest rate cuts. The fact remains that inflation is also in retreat in the US.
> Already the wages, that is the cost of laborThey are the main variable in setting the tone for inflation, together with the productivity (two quantities closely linked). How are wages going? Are they... everywhere cooling albeit very gradually, also because the job market is increasingly on the side of the seller, with the great shortage of workers, even for the anti-immigration policies, with the exception of Hispanics.
> Le raw material, instead, behave in a diversified way: non-energy ones are rising, due to increased manufacturing activity and supply difficulties, while those of oil and gas fluctuate With winter temperatures and the reversals in US-Iran and US-Russia negotiations, all in all, they're neither pushing consumer prices up nor down.
> The effects of artificial intelligence
> In the more or less near future theartificial intelligence will act, like all technological innovations, as deflationary forceA supply-side deflation, that is, a good one, at least until the army of those left behind is so large as to compress wages and demand. A scenario that is now realistic.
> (Very) long yields have stepped up their game
> As already observed, there are many powerful reasons that explain, since the beginning of the decade, the rise of 30-year long-term yieldsThese yields are influenced by the cycle, which can suggest low rates when the economy needs a boost. The thirty-year horizon looks at the structure more than to the economic situation, and sees those pressures on public budgets that are there and will be there for a long time: state spending on infrastructure, For transitions environmental and digital, for the defense… Expenditures that affect all or almost all countries, and therefore extend across space and time, ensuring that, in the communicating vessels of international finance, the hunt for long-term funds continues and will continue. Of course, one should not exaggerate the length of maturities. There are those, like Alphabet, who are considering a 100 year bond, even if only for modest amounts. But 100 years is too long for a buyer, unless it's a pension fund that needs to pair its very long-term bonds with equally long-term guaranteed returns. Austria issued a 100-year sovereign bond, taking advantage of the low interest rates of the pandemic, and it's now trading at 20% of face value... (Of course, if it had been issued with high interest rates—but the issuer would have been ill-advised—things would have turned out differently...).
> The hunt for funding is especially intense now that, at least in America, big tech companies need several billions to finance the huge investments in Artificial IntelligenceThe equally huge profits are not enough for these investments, and the market is preparing to provide the funds, even if there are many question marks: from doubts about the return on these investments to circularity of many deal, a circularity that could amplify the problems once doubts thicken…
> It should be noted that, in America, the interest rate on thirty-year mortgages – a key rate for the American Dream of homeownership – has recently declined more than we would have expected from a parallel comparison with the T-Bond at 30 yearsIt is unclear how much of this is due to high demand factors. bond (Trump ordered public agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy $200 billion in housing bonds) or low housing prices.
> Coming to our house, we are comforted by the fact that the 30-year BTP yields They performed better than the others, in the sense that they grew less, didn't grow at all, or even decreased (depending on the starting point). The graph tells us that it's not just the spread with the Bund that has fallen: both in the 10-year and 30-year government bonds, the spread has gone down (see graph) compared to the average of the main stocks analogues (T-Bond, Bund, JGB, OAT, Bonos and Gilts).
> This means that the trust the markets are placing in Italy also extends across space and time. And our spreads they still have room to go downThe decline in 30-year bonds is significant: it means that the markets see a more stable Italy in the long term, they do not fear relapses into easy finance or the temptations of inflation or political instability or worse (the cover of "Der Spiegel" – spaghetti and guns – during the dark years of terrorism is a distant memory...). Let's take the French case: the spread between BTp and OAT, which had even gone negative (partly due to our merit, partly due to French demerit), has risen towards breakeven on the 10-year maturity, after the French government narrowly managed to secure a yes to the budget, abandoning plans to put its social security accounts in order. But this spread still remains negative in the 30sFrance has bigger public debt problems than Italy…
> As noted in the past, the returns that matter for the growth of the economy are those Really. Italy suffers, for good reasons (inflation is among the lowest of the 21 eurozone countries), from a real rate higher than the Eurozone average (see graph), and higher than the economic growth rate (hoping that the second will approach the first...). But even here the reduction of the spread helps usAs can be seen, the gap between our real rate and that of the Eurozone has narrowed.
> And now we come to the short-term maturities, and in particular to the key rates. Central Bank of Australia It was the first to reverse the direction of rates, and raised them (to 3,85%), after the inflation rate (also core) was confirmed (at 3,80%) above the 2-3% target. Also the Fed, in theory, is in the same situation, with inflation above the 2% target, but there is no chance that it will raise rates: the markets see a moderating price dynamic and a real economy dynamic that is not overheated, and they are only worrying about timing of the next cut, perhaps in June or July. The date is not indicated by chance: it would be the first decision under the new Fed Chairman. Kevin Warsh, assuming that the nomination of the chosen one is confirmed in the Senate, where a Republican senator (who has nothing to lose, since he has already said he will not seek re-election) has repeatedly announced that he will not give the confirmation vote until the issue is resolved grotesque story of the indictment of Jerome Powell by the Trumpian Department of Justice.
> No cuts in the near future on this side of the Atlantic either: ECB, with a key deposit rate of 2%, calm inflation (and stable in the "core" version) and a recovering economy, can afford to leave the rates where they are.
> Dollar weak, Yen and Yuan strengthen
> We have already argued in the past that, if the Trump Administration strongly wants – as it says and repeats – to reduce the trade deficit, there are no possible scenarios that do not include a dollar decline. The duties – it's now clear – they are not the right weapon. The main roads are – alternatively or jointly – or one recession that permanently cuts domestic demand or a dollar that weakens to the point of increasing import prices and stimulating exports. Since a recession is politically unadvisable, the weak dollar.
> In fact, if we look back over the past twenty years, the dollar has room to fallIts real effective exchange rate – see chart – is still uncomfortably strong. At the beginning of 2025, its loss of competitiveness, compared to the average of the first decade of the period, was about 25%. Now the loss has reduced to about 17%, but the American currency still remains uncompetitive. Perhaps this is why Trump he said he wasn't worried about the falling dollar (though his Treasury Secretary later said Besent He tried to patch things up by repeating the hackneyed mantra of the 'strong dollar,' while Warsh talks about a 'healthy dollar.'
> Lo yuan it's slowly happening appreciating, even towards the euro, to tone down the criticism of the rampant Chinese trade surplus. Let's get to the yenWe have already highlighted the anomalous weakening in the past, anomalous because it occurred despite the sharp decline in the interest rate differential between American and Japanese bonds. The latter have risen sharply and should have favored the yen's exchange rate. There are some signs of recovery and a weakening of the anomaly, with the yen having begun—and expected to continue—to strengthen.
> Stock markets: 'Friendly fire' on Wall Street, growth elsewhere
> Stock market legends tell that Joseph kennedy (JFK's father) worked on Wall Street as stockbroker in 1929, and took a break to have his shoes shined. The shoeshine boy, on the sidewalk of that street, gave him some advice on which stocks to buy, at which point Kennedy Sr. decided that if even the shoeshine boys had entered the market, it meant that euphoria had taken over and the top was near. He returned to work, sold everything, and took down options. Shortly thereafter, he made a fortune…
> The story – perhaps apocryphal – comes to mind when looking at how the daily stock trading on Wall Street: they have soared to more than a trillion dollars, doubling compared to a year ago. We don't want to scare anyone; almost a century has passed since then, but caution is warranted...
> Since the arrival of theIA, both the educated and the illustrious continue to ask whether this innovation will wipe out jobs, how many and which ones? But what has happened in recent days is shifting the target. Wall Street is sagging under the 'friendly fire', meaning that many listed companies (in the software field but also in traditional sectors such as real estate, logistics, and asset management) have suffered serious losses. The ones opening the fire are the large and small AI companies, which are putting on the market products aimed at taking away customers from the above companiesCertainly, if the "civil war" were to continue, jobs would also suffer...
> It has been sixteen months since Donald Trump He was elected President of the United States. What impact did Donald Trump's attacks on the international order have on financial investments?
> Starting from the month before his election, and looking at four sizes – Gold, Stock Exchanges excluding the US, Wall Street and Bitcoin, expressed in a common currency, the dollar – let's see the following ranking:
> Bitcoin's bleak performance does not surprise us, given our atavistic aversion to the world of cryptocurrencies, which we have always defined as 'a solution in search of a problem'. More surprising – we have already noted – is the fact that the The American stock market has performed worse than the rest of the world, despite the fact that America is at the forefront of the AI ​​innovation wave and that Trump's tariffs were supposed to benefit the US and harm non-US countries. As already mentioned, better to diversify…

### 3. [Labor protest in China](https://links.org.au/labor-protest-china)
**Source**: Links | **Date**: 2026-02-14T16:26:00+00:00

> The global system has entered the final stage of financial expansion, increasingly leading to armed conflicts at the borders of major players. Russia has opened Pandora’s box by invading Ukraine; Israel has decided to complete its Gaza, Lebanon, and Iran operations once and for all, while the US, tired of its supreme peacekeeper mission, is blackmailing Venezuela. We are past the winter-is-coming stage; the white walkers are already storming the wall.
> Amid all of this, China finds itself in a difficult position. On the one hand, it is about ready to compete for global hegemony, as demonstrated by economic indicators. On the other hand, China’s ambition is undermined by its status as a “global factory,” as its dependency on labor-intensive sectors renders it vulnerable in multiple ways.
> One of China’s weak spots is the social tension that inevitably arises within an industrialized economy of this scale. The global outsourcing of production to China, as seen in the past decades, has made the country the potential epicenter of global workers’ protest. As industrialization progresses, groups of workers have emerged that are capable of self-organization and collective action. The question is if they could become a political force under the right circumstances.
> In the past ten years, the frequency of strikes in China has remained largely the same, averaging at 272 strikes per year throughout the country. This is a modest figure, but comparing year-to-year data reveals significant changes over time. The numbers show a period of increased activity in 2012–2016, peaking in 2014 and declining in later years. The decline was due to the toughening of domestic policies under Xi Jinping. The closure of non-governmental organizations, new laws restricting grassroots civic activity, and political persecution of activists all eroded the infrastructure of workers’ mobilization.
> The average number of strikes in China is comparable to statistics for Germany and the USA (312 and 466 strikes, respectively, in 2023). Unlike these two countries, however, China lacks the key institutions regulating employment relations: it has no independent unions and no established mechanisms of labor arbitration and collective bargaining.
> The change in the number of strikes in recent years indicates the heterogenous situation of the Chinese working class, as described by Ching Kwan Lee: it is split into workers in the Northeast who rely on the state and avoid any conflict with their management, and East Coast workers who seem determined to collectively assert their rights.
> The situation on the East Coast is a manifestation of a well-known pattern: in the absence of industry-wide union federations or structures for labor arbitration, strikes will be common but limited in scope. The country’s Northeast, in turn, has seen industrial decline and the end of the socialist contract wherein the state provided basic protection in exchange for loyalty. This has led to a certain kind of post-socialist passivity: there are hardly any strikes occurring in that region, so few that it drags down the country-wide average.
> The 2012–2016 round of strikes turned out weaker than anticipated. Moreover, it did not lead to the emergence of independent trade unions and other institutional forms of struggle for labor rights. But there are reasons to be optimistic: what if the protests on the East Coast were the first sign of more massive and perhaps more radical changes in the future?
> It is worth taking a closer look at the situation on the East Coast in order to understand the origins, nature, and prospects of labor struggles in modern China. In the next section, I review the recent history and current state of Guangdong Province, a key region for the Chinese economy.
> Guangdong is one of China’s largest and most developed provinces: it is home to 127 million people and has a GDP of $1.83 trillion, which is comparable to modern Russia. Part of the province lies in the Pearl River Delta and is one of the most densely industrialized regions in the world.
> Guangdong’s transformation into a major Chinese economic center dates back to the late 1970s. Located just a few dozen kilometers from Hong Kong, one of the “Four Asian Tigers,” the region became a testing ground for Deng Xiaoping’s policy of “reform and opening up” after the party leadership at the time realized how far China lagged behind its rapidly growing neighbor and decided to undertake major economic reforms.
> For these reasons, the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone was established in Guangdong in 1980. The government launched a small controlled experiment, which proved successful. Abandoning the people’s communes, granting work permits without residence registration, and expanding economic autonomy for enterprises freed up the labor force and laid the foundations for export-oriented industrialization. By 1984, 14 coastal cities had been granted special status.
> Proximity to Hong Kong and the influx of millions of migrant workers from the mainland have transformed the Pearl River Delta into one of the most dynamic industrial hubs in the world. Thousands of small and medium-sized factories in Hong Kong moved their operations to the mainland in search of cheap labor, mostly producing garments and footwear. Asia’s largest trading and manufacturing intermediaries, Li & Fung and TAL Apparel, established their production bases in Shenzhen, Dongguan, and Foshan. They became, during the 1980s and 1990s, a key link between major American brands (Gap, Walmart, Target, etc.) and Chinese factories, supplying the industry in Guangdong with lucrative production contracts.
> Soon production moved beyond clothing and shoes. The now-famous Huawei was established in 1987, originally as a trading company dealing in telephone equipment. A year later, Foxconn opened its first factory in Shenzhen, assembling plastic electronics components. This marked the beginning of a new stage in the region’s development, as its industrial specialization started shifting into producing electronics and components.
> A closer look at the history of Guangdong between 2000 and 2025 reveals, apart from its continuous economic growth, two very different tendencies that prevailed, in sequence, during the two recent decades. The first period, from about 2003 to 2013, resembles Europe in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The economy expanded, public wealth grew, but at the same time, the number of workers also grew, resulting in what Marx called “relative overpopulation,” leading to the gradual impoverishment of workers. Low wages and a huge reserve of migrant labor were the key drivers of Guangdong’s industrial growth.
> The situation changed dramatically in 2010–2023. This was China’s “Lewis turning point,” when the country’s surplus of cheap rural labor was exhausted and wages began to rise. Employment stabilized, while profits per worker began to rise in labor-intensive sectors.
> The more capital is involved in production and the tighter the labor market becomes, the higher the profit per worker and the more capital is forced to curb its appetites. As capital accumulates, if the labor market is limited, the structural power of workers grows. And, according to some estimates, the labor shortage in Guangdong is not a temporary setback but a new defining feature of its economy.
> China’s economy received a huge boost from a combination of cheap labor and commodity exports, but this model is now reaching its limits. To understand what is happening to the region’s workers, what their current needs are, and what the prospects are for the local labor movement, we need to understand who Guangdong’s workers are, how they have evolved in recent years, and how they identify themselves.
> China’s urban population did not exceed its rural population until 2011, although this shift happened a little earlier in Guangdong. This means that China’s urban working class is quite young in the sense that it has only recently emerged. At first, new workers perceived and positioned themselves primarily as internal migrants [author’s note: this can be seen in the new poetry and literature emerging in the region since the 1990s]. As years have passed, the countryside is no longer their home, and the workers have been developing a class consciousness or, at the very least, a professional identity.
> Workers at Guangdong enterprises realize that leaving employment for small business is no longer possible: business in the region is now monopolized, while rent has become extremely expensive. Going back to the countryside is not an option either, as work has become very scarce due to mass urbanization. Thus, under the current circumstances, wage labor in the city remains the only viable option to make ends meet for those who are already employed in the region’s factories.
> Memes shared by young workers reveal a growing sense of pessimism. One example is the meme “Good morning, employees” that became popular in 2020. The phrase appeared in a short video by a Chinese blogger who sarcastically encouraged everyone to work from early morning to late night. The video quickly went viral and the expression turned into a catchphrase.
> Interestingly, the term dǎgōng rén (wage earner), which is used in the meme, has never been part of political or bureaucratic language, although etymologically it is related to the familiar word gōng rén (worker). The term blurs the distinction between blue-collar and white-collar workers and is often associated with low-paying, thankless jobs with no prospects. The mixture of emotion and irony in the memes made the term itself go viral. In some recent memes, the dǎgōng rén have been encouraged to work harder by Mao, Bismarck, and Chekhov.
> Another interesting meme features Tom the cat (of Tom and Jerry) leaving his house with a bundle on a stick behind his back; as he walks away, the ironic caption appears: “A happy worker is leaving for the factory.” Other popular phrases express the joy of being fired. One example is the meme “take the bucket and leave,” which refers to the practice of using plastic buckets to pack up one’s stuff after being laid off.
> Most memes express the workers’ passive acceptance of their plight as well as a sense of disillusionment. People would like stable employment, sufficient income and a permissive schedule, but they get none of that. As shown by the campaign organized by programmers against the “996” schedule (working from 9 to 9, 6 days a week), a proper work-life balance remains elusive even for highly skilled workers.
> All of this explains the sudden popularity of working-class stories, some of which may even be said to have achieved a cult status. Examples include Hu Anyan’s book I Deliver Parcels in Beijing, which sold 100,000 copies in less than a year, and Wen Muye’s film Miracle: The Story of a Simple Guy (internationally released as Nice View). The film tells the story of a young worker, Jing Hao, raising his sister and surviving on odd jobs ranging from repairing phones to washing high-rise windows in Shenzhen.
> There are even video games about working conditions, such as The Majority. It simulates the everyday experience of a wage earner, including various odd job opportunities. Some aspects of the game imply social criticism and demands for changes in working conditions, such as the question of why workers should have to buy their own tools.
> The proportion of experienced specialists aged 30–40 among factory workers is growing, while young people are finding jobs in the city that pay just as much (for example, in delivery services). Workers’ standards have grown, and they are willing to get by on odd jobs just so they don’t feel bound to a particular factory owner. Behind this choice lies a dream of self-realization and more decent working conditions. And although economic conditions are unfavorable, the need for self-realization is like a stretched spring that will have to be released sooner or later.
> And yet the workers’ pain, their anxieties and grievances have remained the same. The situation in which workers begin to perceive themselves as subjects capable of realizing their own interests, rather than as toys in the hands of the powerful, is less a condition than a consequence of collective action. When workers act together, they begin to understand that each person’s strategy for earning a living intersects with the experiences of many others. Their identity as workers, which is formed as they become aware of themselves as the driving force of production, will be strengthened in political practice.
> Over time, workers in Guangdong’s factories are coming to better understand their role in the workplace, the country, and the world at large. They play through their feelings in memes and video games, creating genuine rituals and collectively taking up public space. The problem is that the maturing of Guangdong workers and development of their self-consciousness is happening in a system that resists self-organization.
> China is currently undergoing a process of elite consolidation. This contrasts the earlier situation when former President Hu Jintao balanced between the Shanghai and the Youth League groups within the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CPC). The former faction represented the technocratic elite of the coastal regions, while the latter consisted of members of the Communist Youth League apparatus. These groups mainly competed for resources and influence within the CPC and did not have serious ideological differences. At the same time, the very existence of competition within the party served to keep its chairman’s personal ambition in check.
> Since Xi Jinping took over the party, the Shanghai group has lost its influence and collective governance has become a thing of the past. The 2012 anti-corruption campaign served as the final blow to the faction, as its prominent member Zhou Yongkang became the first member of the Politburo Standing Committee in history to be arrested and sentenced to life imprisonment. Having taken control of both levers of power — the party and the military — Xi Jinping is now able to directly govern the work of many state bodies.
> This consolidation of power was followed by a domestic crackdown. Authoritarian regulations adopted in the mid-2010s, including the National Security Law and the Law on the Management of Foreign NGOs, undermined the mechanisms of political mobilization. As these laws introduced new types of punishment by expanding the range of offenses, the ultimate goal was to preclude the very existence of independent organizations and to build a network of public structures loyal to the state.
> It is for this purpose, presumably, that the state apparatus seeks to eliminate any alternative forms of labor organization. A telling example was the strike at the Lide shoe factory in Guangdong, which resulted in the arrest of about twenty labor activists. 2,500 factory workers went on strike for eight months against the relocation of the enterprise and layoffs. The workers also demanded that the factory fulfill its social obligations if it closed, including paying social insurance and housing fund contributions.
> The factory workers were assisted by the Panyu Migrant Workers’ Center, acting as an informal trade union. The Panyu Center even succeeded in organizing a system of representation at the factory. The success of the strike drew interest from the government. Arrests followed; multiple Panyu employees were sentenced to suspended prison terms, and the center’s work in labor rights protection was effectively ended.
> A similar scenario played out in 2018 in Shenzhen when local university students organized a campaign of solidarity with the employees of Jasic Technology, a company that manufactures welding equipment. After a series of layoffs, the workers attempted to legally establish a union at the company. They were supported by 50 Marxist students from various universities who formed an informal group known as the Jasic Worker Solidarity Group.
> This was the first attempt at solidarity between students and workers in a long time. The students traveled to Shenzhen, participated in pickets, and helped workers with their statements. In August 2018, the police raided the apartments where student activists were gathering. Many were arrested, and some disappeared for several months. Although they were all later released, some of the students were expelled from their universities and put under heavy surveillance, including restrictions on their freedom of movement and regular interviews with the police. The Marxist Society at Peking University was not allowed to re-register. The vibrant community of activists was forced to disband.
> More recently, in 2024, amid a generally quiet atmosphere, new online initiatives emerged, dedicated exclusively to labor issues and workers’ rights, including “Workers’ Facts,” “Labor News: About Modern Workers,” and “Daily Protests.” As the offensive power of the labor movement was suppressed, the activist work shifted online.
> China is often compared to Korea in the 1970s, when informal Korean student groups built networks of solidarity with workers, operating underground and devising various ways to support them. Initiatives multiplied, and a social explosion was brewing. Looking at Guangdong in isolation, this comparison would seem quite convincing.
> However, China is a huge country in which the deindustrialized Northeast coexists with rapidly urbanizing provinces such as Henan and Hubei. Guangdong is an epicenter of worker rebellion, whereas other inland provinces see much less of it. Protest is not entirely absent from the Northeast, but it is limited to tamer activities like petitions and local rallies.
> One of the common ways in which capital responds to wage growth is through the relocation of production.
> The beginning of industrial migration dates back to the 2000s, when the authorities deliberately freed up infrastructure space for new industries. But it wasn’t until 2017 that this gradual process snowballed. The 2022 Shenzhen Manufacturing Industry Migration Review Report shows a drastic increase in the scale of this exodus: while 463 enterprises had left the city in 2017, by 2021, the number had risen to 4,344. In just a few years, Shenzhen has faced a mass relocation of the enterprises that formed its industrial core.
> Most of Shenzhen’s manufacturing remains within Guangdong province, but in recent years, it has been moving further and further away from the expensive Pearl River Delta agglomeration. Manufacturers are moving to peripheral hubs like Dongguan, Foshan, and Huizhou, as well as to less developed parts of the region.
> But the movement of industrial capital is not limited to Guangdong. The same 2022 Shenzhen report lists three principal locations to which companies are fleeing: first, to the Yangtze River Delta industrial cluster; second, to the central regions of Jiangxi and Hubei, where new cluster zones are forming; and third, all the way to western provinces that have been on the periphery of industrial growth for decades.
> Intensifying labor protest is a factor in this relocation, alongside rising wages: faced with worker mobilization, capital is moving production to new locations in order to increase profitability. At the same time, job losses as a result of relocations also mean that the strikes of 2021–2024 were defensive in nature, mainly fought over wage delays and relocations: a gesture of despair rather than an expression of political power.
> The slowdown in economic activity on the East Coast weakens the offensive nature of labor protests. And yet the protests are scaling up. As workers become more organized and capital relocates, new hotbeds of labor protest will form in other regions. Thus, the relocation of production, though it keeps undermining the possibility of forming a stable organization of wage workers in one place, ultimately creates the conditions for a new round of collective struggle — now at the national level.
> The Chinese strike wave of 2010–2016 did not lead to a rise of institutions representing workers nor to a new wave of radicalization. The strikes were mostly limited to Guangdong, initiated by workers who saw themselves primarily as migrants. The times, however, have changed both for the region and for the country in general. This new period is marked by an economic downturn, which is usually associated with a decline in strike activity. At the same time, the current economic crisis is ambiguous, the economy is rather unstable, and capital relocation is uneven. This means that general uncertainty may increase workers’ dissatisfaction with their situation and contribute to their radicalization.
> Also, the transfer of production to new regions of China may itself encourage the spread of protest. Industrialization usually upends conservative ways both of understanding oneself and of organizing one’s life.
> The 2010–2016 strike cycle in China coincided with an authoritarian turn that proved too much for it to handle. Although the crackdown on activist organizations after the strike at the Lide shoe factory was a turning point, communities of worker activists survived. As China moves along the capitalist path and develops its industries in new regions, society will become even more complex and social contradictions even more acute. And autocracies are powerless to stop this process.

### 4. [China has another solution to its shrinking population: robots](https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/13/china/china-population-robots-intl-hnk-dst)
**Source**: CNN | **Date**: 2026-02-14T04:01:00+00:00

> China’s birth rate has hit a historic low – deepening fears of a major economic shock in the decades to come as the country’s massive labor force dwindles and its population of pension-drawing retirees swells.
> A flurry of policies from Chinese authorities to spur procreation – from cash handouts and tax breaks to new rules making marriage easier – has so far failed to stop the downward slide, data released last month shows.
> But the country is also eyeing another potential fix: robots and automation.
> Chinese leader Xi Jinping has for years overseen a push to upgrade and automate the country’s manufacturing sector, part of Beijing’s goal to transform China into a self-sufficient high-tech powerhouse.
> That push is now converging with Beijing’s rush to address the rebalancing of its population, which, if unaddressed, threatens to break the pension system, drive up families’ health care costs and crush productivity – dragging down faith in public institutions and economic output in one swoop.
> “If (China) just carries on exactly the same as it has been in the last 20 or 30 years, then it’s going to be a massive crisis, because of the mismatch between their population system and their economic system – but why would they do that?” said Stuart Gietel-Basten, a demography expert at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.
> If handled well, experts say, China’s push into automation and AI – alongside other adaptations – could go a long way to help stop economic growth from falling off a demographic cliff – at least for decades to come.
> But managing a high-tech transition – one that would cost people jobs in the short term and change the nature of work in the long term – is a steep challenge for governments around the world. Let alone in a country of 1.4 billion people that built decades of growth on the back of its expansive workforce.
> And the stakes are particularly high for a ruling Communist Party that has pegged its legitimacy to economic stability and aims to make China a “mid-level developed country” within the next decade.
> How Beijing prepares now will have long-term implications for the global economy and on generations to come, experts say, and that’s not just about trying to arrest falling birth rates.
> “If China can achieve sustained gains in labor productivity through robots, digitalization and AI, then it can maintain – or increase – industrial output with fewer workers on the factory floor,” said Guojun He, an economics professor at the University of Hong Kong.
> That means “automation can significantly mitigate, but not completely neutralize, the economic impact of a shrinking workforce, especially in industrial production.” But those impacts will be different across industries – and require a “combination of policies” from education to social security to land well, he added.
> China is already by far the world’s largest industrial robot market and home to more than half of all robots installed worldwide in 2024, according to the International Federation of Robotics.
> Across the country, robotic arms work in concert to weld, paint and assemble goods in highly automated lines, or even in “dark” factories, where there’s no need to waste electricity keeping on the lights for human eyes.
> High levels of automation are what’s enabling Chinese factories to pump out cutting-edge electric vehicles and solar panels at large scale and low prices – driving their soaring trade surplus with the rest of the world.
> Beijing is also betting heavily on humanoid robots, with more than 140 companies in China now developing them in a field flush with government subsidies.
> China’s robot sports craze could eventually put humanoids in homes
> So far, these humanoids are most visible as showpieces of China’s tech ambitions, dancing in formation on televised specials and duking it out at promotional boxing matches.
> But some have already been piloted on assembly lines, in logistics hubs and in science labs. Their developers say they are still a ways off, but getting closer to matching human productivity in tasks like handling, sorting, and quality inspection.
> All this is part of a top-down push to ensure China keeps its competitive advantage in a new era of high tech and rising labor costs, outlined in the government’s “Made in China 2025” plan released in 2015 – the same year Beijing decided to scrap its controversial, decades-long “one-child” population control regime.
> While the looming population crunch may not have been the driving force behind the industrial policy, voices within China have framed automation, robotics and AI as tools to mitigate its harms.
> “Since the population numbers are starting to turn against China, this idea of automation, and now AI … has become part of the script of … ‘We’re going to have all this productivity increase and therefore (population decline) won’t matter,’” said Bert Hofman, a professor at the East Asian Institute at the National University Singapore and former World Bank country director for China.
> That official vision includes robots not just as factory workers, but as caregivers to the burgeoning population of adults over 60, who now make up 23% of the population but could account for more than half by 2100, per United Nations projections.
> The urgent need to expand systems to care for those aging adults is compounded by the legacy of the “one-child” policy, which created a generation of only children who will care for parents without siblings to share the burden.
> Ten years after it ended its ‘one-child’ policy, China’s push for more babies isn’t winning its citizens over
> Recent government guidelines have called for advancing humanoid robots and AI technologies to enhance elder care, as well as developing brain-computer interfaces, exoskeleton robots and muscle suits to assist elderly citizens with declining physical functions.
> State media regularly highlights ambitions of rolling out humanoid robots to help older adults with around-the-clock caregiving – perhaps a bid to make more people open to the idea.
> Another concern is the state-backed pension system, which many elderly Chinese rely on and predictions suggest could move into deficit as the population ages without more reform.
> Here too, the “race between technology advancement and population aging,” could have a bearing, according to Tianzeng Xu, a China analyst with the Economist Intelligence Unit.
> If tech progress can significantly boost labor productivity then, in theory, each worker would be able to contribute more to the system even when there are more retirees to support, Xu said.
> “Provided the former outpaces the latter by certain margins, the improvement of labor productivity is still possible to keep our pension system afloat.”
> But it’s uncertain how exactly all that will play out, not just for a strained pension system, but the economy at large – especially in the latter half of the century when the demographic decline deepens considerably.
> “In this race between population decline and productivity increase, China (stays) well ahead until the 2070s when labor force decline is going to be more rapid than productivity increase,” said Hofman, citing projections based on OECD long-term scenarios.
> Even still, he added, it’s hard to say how fundamentally new technologies will change work – and “productivity may very well surprise us.”
> The other side of that coin is how the high-tech transition will affect the workforce, as making a country more productive doesn’t mean that more people have jobs; it could just mean fewer people do more.
> China is already facing a double bind of labor shortages in some sectors and unemployment in others. Even if tech-boosted productivity can stabilize the economy over time, it could first deepen that economic pain.
> Estimates for how many workers could be displaced by AI and robots in China vary, but domestic experts have estimated that this tech could affect around 70% of China’s manufacturing sector. Last month, officials said they would roll out a set of policy measures to address the impact of its rapid adoption on jobs.
> “The timing issue is very important – in the long term, automation is part of the solution to a smaller workforce. In the short-to-medium term, if not managed well, it risks displacing workers who do not yet have clear alternative opportunities, adding to social and political pressures,” said He in Hong Kong.
> Managing this requires a “serious investment in reskilling and upskilling,” so that ordinary workers and technicians can move from repetitive manual work to working with automated systems or moving into higher-value services, he said.
> It will also require stronger social security policies to support workers as they change jobs, locations or sectors or face unemployment, He added.
> And overall, experts stress automation is just one part of a range of measures besides pro-birth policies that Beijing can take to mitigate the economic and social impact of the deepening demographic shift.
> Along with investing in education to give workers better skills, those also include continuing to reform the pension system (which saw the retirement age raised for the first time in 2024) and efforts to keep people in formal work longer, according Philip O’Keefe, a professor at the Centre for Population Ageing Research at Australia’s University of New South Wales.
> “While no doubt the very low birth rate will have big implications for society, the decline in total and working age population will happen over time, with time to adjust,” he said.

### 5. [Aid cuts, global conflicts derail Malawi's HIV/AIDS Response](https://www.maravipost.com/aid-cuts-global-conflicts-derail-malawis-hivaids-response/)

> MZUZU-(MaraviPost)-A shift in priorities by major donor countries toward wars in Ukraine, Iran, and parts of Africa—coupled with punitive legal frameworks—continues to undermine global efforts against the deadly HIV/AIDS epidemic.
> United States President Donald Trump implemented a policy that reduced foreign aid by 75%, cut the State Department’s budget by 50%, and eliminated funding for the United Nations and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
> As a result, major donors are now allocating more resources to defense while reducing HIV funding, citing the Russia–Ukraine conflict and the financial strain on more than 20 international organizations.
> Locally, the central government’s failure to adequately fund HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention initiatives at town and district council levels has nearly crippled outreach programs targeting both ordinary citizens and key populations at risk.
> On Friday in Mzuzu, the Mzuzu City Executive Committee approved the commencement of the 17‑month Powerful Prevention Project, a United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) funded initiative implemented by the Community Health Rights Advocacy (CHeRA).
> Stakeholders at the meeting lamented the chronic shortage of resources for HIV/AIDS interventions.
> CHeRA Programmes Manager Alex Dalitso Kaomba underscored Malawi’s persistent struggle with high HIV prevalence, particularly among key populations—men who have sex with men (12.9%), female sex workers (49.9%), transgender people, and people who use drugs.
> He warned that the recent taxation on condoms poses “a huge setback in the prevention of the deadly virus,” adding:
> “It is no longer a secret, many projects have failed following the suspension of UNAIDS‑funded initiatives both at national and district levels, necessitating the need to improvise sustainable HIV‑AIDS prevention measures.”
> Kaomba praised the consortium of 40 civil society organizations under the Mzuzu City Society Network (MCSN) for supporting CHeRA’s transparent and inclusive implementation of the UNDP‑funded project.
> Echoing his concerns, CHeRA Technical Assistant Dingani Mithi called for the repeal of outdated punitive legal provisions that criminalize the existence of key populations, noting that such laws only fuel stigmatization.
> “Indeed some of the legal provisions need to be revisited as they do not conform with technologies in the fight against the deadly global epidemic. It is tricky at the moment to operate in an environment where interventions conflict with the law,” Mithi said.
> Mzuzu City Council’s Principal Nutrition and HIV‑AIDS Officer Augustin Gama lamented the withdrawal of U.S. government funding, stressing the urgent need for sustainable interventions.
> “We need sustainable interventions in the fight against the deadly HIV‑AIDS pandemic following the withdrawal of funding by UNAIDS. The CHeRA project must be commended as it tackles the hard‑to‑reach key populations,” Gama said.
> Mzuzu City, within Mzimba North District, has identified HIV/AIDS hotspot areas at Zolozolo Health Clinic, Mzuzu Urban Health Centre, and Mzuzu University Health Clinic, where alarming transmission rates continue to concern health officials.
> Despite these challenges, Council Chairperson Gama reaffirmed the city’s commitment to achieving the global 95‑95‑95 targets aimed at ending the pandemic by 2030.
> However, in early 2025, the U.S. government paused foreign assistance, severely disrupting PEPFAR‑funded HIV/AIDS programs across Africa.
> The suspension affected services for more than 20 million people, leading to immediate shortages of antiretroviral (ART) medicines, clinic closures, and the halting of prevention outreach—particularly in countries such as Kenya, Uganda, Zimbabwe, Malawi, and South Africa.
> For Malawi, the impact was especially dire. HIV/AIDS has long acted as a drag on economic development, reducing annual GDP growth by an estimated 1.2% to 1.5%.
> While expanded access to ART has helped mitigate some of these effects, the epidemic continues to impose heavy indirect costs on labour productivity, household income, and the public sector.
> In response, initiatives like the CHeRA project have stepped in to strengthen prevention and treatment. With a budget of MK66,690,000, the project covers Blantyre, Lilongwe, Mangochi, and Mzimba North, targeting 500 key populations on antiretroviral therapy.
> It forms part of the global Powerful Prevention campaign supported by UNDP, underscoring the importance of sustained international cooperation in the fight against HIV/AIDS.

### 1. [Governance in a risk era defined by geopolitical uncertainty](https://www.accountingtoday.com/opinion/governance-in-a-risk-era-defined-by-geopolitical-uncertainty)
**Source**: Accounting Today | **Date**: 2026-02-13T23:40:00+00:00

> One of the most rewarding aspects of my role as President and CEO of The Institute of Internal Auditors is the opportunity to engage with practitioners around the world. Hearing directly from those on the front lines of the profession is fundamental to how we operate as a global association and is critical to our ability to remain agile in how we support and guide practitioners.
> Over the past year, one theme dominated those conversations. Around the world, audit, risk and accounting teams are grappling with rising geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty — how to monitor, track and proactively manage risk levels when the global landscape seems to shift daily.
> This growing uncertainty isn't merely anecdotal; it's firmly rooted in research. In the IIA's 2026 Risk in Focus survey, geopolitical uncertainty risk rankings in North America jumped from 26% to 45% compared to last year, marking the largest risk level increase across all areas, including cybersecurity, digital disruption and regulatory change.
> The Risk in Focus findings also highlight how audit professionals are increasingly leaning on cross-functional collaboration to address geopolitical risk. Internal auditors recognize that geopolitical uncertainty, such as unpredictability in trade policy, or regional instability, is vast and nuanced. It impacts multiple risk domains such as regulatory compliance, market performance and trade operations. As a result, close collaboration and consistent communication between internal audit, accounting, risk management and financial operations have become both an organizational priority and a resilience imperative. The era of siloed departments is over.
> The Risk in Focus research also benchmarks how audit functions are responding and adapting in today's changing risk environment.
> This year, financial and liquidity risks emerged as a top five audit priority alongside business resilience, cybersecurity, corporate reporting and regulatory change. This is significant and relevant for management, accounting and finance professionals as it reflects just how important an organization's financial operations and financial security are within an increasingly complex and diverse external risk environment.
> It's also interesting to look at financial liquidity's prominence in audit plans within the context of increasing geopolitical risk. Geopolitical developments can disrupt financial risk in myriad ways, including funding constraints as investors become more risk-averse; supply chain or trade disruptions that interrupt payments and revenue streams; and sanctions that restrict or reshape access to international markets.
> In this context, financial and liquidity risks can no longer be viewed as narrowly as a finance function, but a strategic risk area that requires cross-functional coordination and forward-looking insight. Internal auditors and accounting professionals are increasingly being called upon to support more dynamic and proactive liquidity monitoring, scenario planning and stress testing. This includes contingency planning for risks that can directly impact financial liquidity, such as shifts in federal funding, market volatility, and human capital or supply chain disruptions.
> These dynamics reinforce the increasingly critical role of internal audit and accounting. In a risk environment defined by rapid geopolitical change and heightened financial and liquidity concerns, audit and accounting stand as a critical line of defense — helping ensure effective monitoring, strong internal controls and accurate, robust financial reporting to support organizational stability.
> As today's rapidly evolving risk landscape continues to reshape organizational strategy and operations, the organizations that prioritize close, ongoing collaboration between internal audit, accounting, finance and risk management will be best positioned to adapt, endure and lead into the future.

## 📌 Topic: Energy Market Volatility and Transition

### 1. [This Sector Is Unexpectedly Crushing the Rest of the Market This Year](https://www.fool.com/investing/2026/02/14/this-sector-is-unexpectedly-crushing-the-rest-of/)
**Source**: The Motley Fool | **Date**: 2026-02-14T18:02:00+00:00

> The energy sector has soared in 2026, surprising many analysts.
> Late last year, energy was looking like the sector to avoid in 2026. That's because a global oil glut was sending oil prices lower, and oil stocks with them. In December, there were 1.4 billion barrels of "oil on the water" -- i.e., oil being shipped to a port or stored and waiting for a buyer. That was 24% more than the average for December from 2016 to 2024.
> As a result, West Texas Intermediate, the type of oil extracted from oilfields in the U.S., was trading in late December at about $57 a barrel, $15 below where it started the year. Brent, the benchmark for oil from Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, was priced at about $60 a barrel, also $15 below where it was at the beginning of 2025.In response to sagging oil prices, investors were dumping energy stocks and looking for 2026 winners elsewhere.
> Well, surprise, surprise. As of the second week of February 2026, the energy sector is leading the pack. And few saw it coming. The State Street Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLE +0.69%) is up 23% year to date, beating every other S&P sector and crushing the broad S&P 500, which is up less than 2% year to date.
> Several of the U.S. oil majors (the world's largest and most influential publicly traded oil companies) are soaring. Here are a few of the leaders:
> 2026 year-to-date return (as of Feb. 11)
> What is driving these stocks (and almost all of the other stocks in the S&P 500 energy sector) to outperform the broader market so dramatically? Well, it's not exactly clear. But there are theories.
> One is that aggressive U.S. foreign policy is behind it. Since the U.S. military captured and detained Venezuelan President Nicholas Maduro on Jan. 3, many investors have begun to think that oil majors like Chevron and Exxon will now have access to Venezuela's oil reserves, which, at 19.4 billion barrels, are considered to be the world's largest. Indeed, Venezuela sits on a fifth of the world's proven oil reserves.
> The biggest oil companies could be given special access to Venezuelan oilfields by the Trump administration. Just as importantly, both companies have large, complex oil refineries on the U.S. Gulf Coast that can handle the heavy sour blend of oil that Venezuela produces. And Chevron already has operations in Venezuela.
> In addition, the White House has increased hostilities with Iran in recent weeks. It has already positioned one aircraft carrier group near that nation's coast and may be preparing to send another.  Any kind of U.S. strike on or war with Iran would undoubtedly send global oil prices higher, at least temporarily, as Iran is a major energy producer and sits at an energy choke point, the Strait of Hormuz.
> Other theories hold that as investors tire of putting money into artificial intelligence (AI)-related stocks, some fell back on energy stocks as a reliable long-term bet. But can the rally in energy stocks last?
> Personally, I would be careful investing too much here. It will take many years and much capital to get Venezuela's oil sector back to fully or even mostly operational. And any U.S. conflict with Iran, if it happens, would likely be very brief. Instead, a wait-and-see approach to energy stocks makes more sense.
