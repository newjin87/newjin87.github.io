> Feb 17 (Reuters) - San Francisco Federal Reserve President Mary ‌Daly on Tuesday said ‌the U.S. central bank still needs ​to get inflation down, and that while artificial intelligence potentially helps in that ‌regard, the ⁠Fed's modestly or slightly restrictive policy is also ⁠important to making that happen.
> "We need to get ​inflation down ​and we ​need to ‌make sure that it's on a good path," Daly said at an event at San Jose State University, adding ‌that the Fed ​also needs to ​make ​sure that labor ‌market vulnerabilities -- like the ​narrow ​range of industries that account for most of current ​US ‌job creation don't turn ​into labor market fragilities.

### 2. [Fed's Barr casts doubt on AI as rate-cutting tool](https://www.aol.com/articles/feds-barr-casts-doubt-ai-190809671.html)

> Federal Reserve governor Michael Barr said Tuesday that the boom in artificial intelligence "is unlikely to be a reason for lowering policy rates," disputing the idea of AI as a productivity accelerator that puts the Fed on a rate-cutting path.
> While he believes the impact of AI will likely be "profoundly positive" in the long run, it may deeply disrupt the job market in the short term and harm some workers.
> Barr also warned that AI could be inflationary, offering the example of electricity supply constraints on the power grid colliding with booming energy demand from data centers.
> "For all of these reasons, I expect that the AI boom is unlikely to be a reason for lowering policy rates," Barr said in a speech at the New York Association for Business Economics.
> The comments strike a starkly different tone from what Fed Chair nominee Kevin Warsh has said about AI, namely that the technology will usher in "the most productivity-enhancing wave of our lifetimes" and be "structurally disinflationary," allowing for lower interest rates.

> Barr sounded equally hawkish on the more conventional measure of inflation and job market health
> "I would like to see evidence that goods price inflation is sustainably retreating before considering reducing the policy rate further, provided labor market conditions remain stable," he said.
> "Based on current conditions and the data in hand," he added, "it will likely be appropriate to hold rates steady for some time as we assess incoming data."
> Barr joins a chorus of Fed officials in recent days who have said they want to see inflation slow before looking at cutting rates. Chicago Fed president Austan Goolsbee told Yahoo Finance on Friday that he would also like to see further progress on inflation falling to the Federal Reserve's 2% target before supporting another rate cut.
> A reading of the Consumer Price Index for January, released Feb. 13, showed prices rose 2.4% over the prior year. On a "core" basis, which excludes food and energy, prices rose 2.5% over the prior year.
> This Friday, the Commerce Department will release the Fed's preferred inflation gauge — the Personal Consumption Expenditures Index — which economists expect to rise 2.9% in December on a core basis. That would compare with 2.8% in November.
> Barr said he believes inflation remains elevated at 3% based on PCE, as tariffs have pushed up goods prices. Looking ahead, he said it's "reasonable" to anticipate that the impact of tariffs on inflation will begin to lift later this year, but cautioned that there are "many reasons to be concerned that inflation will remain elevated."
> "I see the risk of persistent inflation above our 2% target as significant, which means we need to remain vigilant," Barr said.
> Read more: How AI, unemployment, and interest rates could shape the stock market and your investments
> Barr said that with job creation near zero over the past year, coupled with a low firing rate, there's a "delicate balance" making the job market vulnerable to negative shocks.
> Barr also warned that while he believes the impact of AI will likely be "profoundly positive" in the long run, in the short term, AI may deeply disrupt the job market and harm some workers.
> He said AI could impact the job market in a couple of different ways. On one hand, it could lead to strong productivity growth while avoiding widespread job losses amid more gradual adoption.
> Under another scenario, Barr sees rapid adoption ushering in a "jobless boom." In that scenario, AI agents could replace or displace a range of professional and service occupations. Autonomous vehicles and robotics could automate many manufacturing and transportation jobs, with labor increasingly concentrated in a few manual or highly skilled trades.
> "The extent of disruption will depend in part on whether society undertakes the investments needed in new job creation, worker training, connecting workers to new jobs, and other efforts to mitigate adverse labor market effects," Barr said.
> Meanwhile, San Francisco Fed president Mary Daly invoked former Fed Chair Alan Greenspan in a speech on Tuesday in San Jose, Calif. She said Greenspan looked past official data in the 1990s, which hadn't yet incorporated higher productivity from technological advances, and held rates steady rather than raising them.
> Daly suggested that perhaps the Fed should do the same with AI.
> "It is a reminder that monetary policy is a forward-looking business," Daly said.
> "We won't find all the answers in the aggregate data on productivity, the labor market, or inflation," she said. "Seeing developments before they fully emerge requires digging deeper, relying on disaggregated information that foreshadows transformation."
> Daly stressed that Greenspan's innovation wasn't looking at more data; it was looking at the right data —finding inconsistencies in what he saw and working to resolve them.

### 3. [Yen reverses Monday's losses, euro/dollar edges down before Fed minutes, U.S. GDP](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/17/yen-reverses-mondays-losses-euro/dollar-edges-down-before-fed-minutes-us-gdp.html)
**Source**: CNBC | **Date**: 2026-02-17T09:03:00+00:00

> The U.S. dollar rose against major currencies on Tuesday as geopolitical tensions from the ongoing U.S.-Iran nuclear talks unleashed more market uncertainty and a risk-off mood among investors.
> Iran and the U.S. reached an understanding on the main "guiding principles" in a second round of indirect talks over their nuclear dispute on Tuesday, although a deal is not imminent, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said.
> The U.S. has sent a battle force to the Middle East to press Tehran to make concessions in the decades-long dispute. President Donald Trump has said "regime change" in Tehran may be the best thing that can happen.
> The dollar tends to do better in times of uncertainty, with investors buying U.S. Treasuries and selling equities, said Eugene Epstein, head of trading and structured products at Moneycorp in New Jersey.
> "Treasury yields are coming off quite a bit and you also have the dollar strengthening, which is kind of funny because it's back to the old mentality of risk-off. There's a potential conflict with Iran so you have the traditional buy U.S. dollar, buy U.S. Treasuries and sell equities, and that's seemingly what's going on today," he said.
> The dollar was up 0.57% to 0.774 francs against the Swiss franc . The euro was down 0.34% at $1.181, on track for the sixth straight session of losses against the dollar. The dollar index rose 0.41% to 97.50.
> "We have all the conditions technically for the dollar weakening - with the market currently pricing in the most amount of Fed cuts since the end of last year and bond yields coming off etc - and yet the dollar is strengthening. My guess is it's due primarily to this Iranian conflict," Epstein said.
> Investors are also awaiting minutes from the Fed's last meeting and key economic data later in the week. U.S. stocks, including the benchmark S&P 500edged mostly lower in choppy trading. The yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes fell 1.2 basis points to 4.045%.
> The Japanese yen weakened for the second straight session after snapping a five-day winning streak triggered by the election victory of Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi.
> Money flowing into Japan's ebullient stock market is expected to support the yen. However, Japan's Nikkei fell on Tuesday as investors booked profits, while the post-election euphoria was ebbing.
> The yen was down 0.17% against the greenback to 153.78 per dollar.
> The pound dropped after data showed Britain's unemployment rate rose to a five-year high in December while wage growth cooled, potentially adding to the case for further Bank of England rate cuts. The sterling weakened 0.9% to $1.3502.
> The Australian dollar weakened 0.38% versus the greenback to $0.7042. The dollar strengthened 0.13% to 6.891 versus the offshore Chinese yuan.

### 4. [The US economy is turning](https://www.ft.com/content/1faba8de-7fcf-480f-8509-aa528708dc19)

> This article is an on-site version of our Chris Giles on Central Banks newsletter. Premium subscribers can sign up here to get the newsletter delivered every Tuesday. Standard subscribers can upgrade to Premium here, or explore all FT newsletters
> Last week, financial markets were prepared for a story about AI displacing workers in the US labour market. Economists were drawing up scenarios for the US economy without any net job creation. And the Trump administration was getting ready for some ugly data to explain away. None of that happened.
> The US economy created 130,000 jobs last month and an average of 30,000 roles a month in the year to January 2026. Unemployment fell for the second consecutive month to 4.3 per cent, just a touch above its 4.2 per cent rate in February last year. Even though there was the expected large downward revision to 2025 jobs growth, all the data was far better than expected.
> The figures raise three questions. Whatever happened to the recent narrative on jobs? Is the US achieving a Eurozone-style “good place” for monetary policy? Or is it still facing something hotter and perhaps a bit more Australian?
> Just after January’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting that held US interest rates in the 3.5 to 3.75 per cent range, Federal Reserve governor Christopher Waller justified his dissenting vote in favour of a rate cut by arguing it would “strengthen the labour market and guard against a deterioration that would be harder to address once it has begun”. He worried that the expected revision would leave US jobs growth at “zero. Zip. Nada.”
> It was just one month’s data, but the emerging reality is that strong US GDP growth has been improving the country’s labour market, as we would expect. Pretty much all the data last week was positive and diminished the recent paradox of very strong activity figures alongside weak jobs numbers.
> If you compare a series of representative US labour market indicators with their values in 2000 to 2019, as we have done on the FT’s Monetary Policy Radar and below in a chart, the jobs market looks normal — or even a bit stronger than normal.
> Some content could not load. Check your internet connection or browser settings.
> Unemployment at 4.3 per cent puts it now back within the FOMC’s central tendency for the equilibrium rate. With joblessness falling to a level deemed normal, it is hard to assert that interest rates are obviously restrictive — and Fed officials are noticing. Lorrie Logan, Dallas Fed president and this year a voting FOMC member, was ahead of the game before the data came out last week, saying “our current stance of policy may be very close to neutral and providing little restraint on economic activity and inflation”.
> The case for a more dovish interpretation of US labour market data now rests on cherry-picking, such as looking at private sector hiring rates or asserting that the equilibrium unemployment rate is way below the FOMC’s median estimate of 4.2 per cent.
> Some content could not load. Check your internet connection or browser settings.
> Alternatively, advocates of a more dovish approach could take the financial market view that we are just about to see the destructive side of creative destruction, even though that is not yet showing up in the data. Or they could simply declare that the Phillips curve approach is misconceived, forecast stable low inflation and cut rates.
> For some time now, the European Central Bank has said it is in a “good place” because inflation in the bloc is stable, the Eurozone labour market has improved and there is little reason to raise or lower interest rates. It has achieved a soft landing, even if some parts of the single currency area, especially Germany, do not see it that way.
> This story is also likely to play out in the US as the country moves towards on-track inflation and economic stability. (Though the US will have higher growth than the Eurozone because of its underlying dynamism, especially in the tech sector.)
> Some content could not load. Check your internet connection or browser settings.
> CPI inflation is not quite back at 2 per cent and the last mile of disinflation in the US is proving difficult. But there is a good chance that the Fed will get back to its target. Nothing in the data suggests this is not a reasonably strong possibility.
> With some better news from the jobs market last week, the soft landing story is stronger than it was. This would suggest that the neutral interest rate is closer to 3.5 to 4 per cent rather than the 3 per cent median that the FOMC currently believes. This equilibrium is also predicated on the Federal budget deficit remaining somewhere close to its current unsustainable 6 per cent level.
> It is important not to cherry-pick data to generate a narrative. But if I do just that in the chart below, you can see the striking similarity between US and Australian unemployment rates — and a warning from down under about inflation.
> In short, Australia in 2023 and 2024 experienced disinflation while its unemployment rate was rising, almost mirroring the rise in US joblessness. The Australian labour market tightened earlier than that of the US and Australian inflation has jumped, rising close to 4 per cent.
> Some content could not load. Check your internet connection or browser settings.
> Such was the abrupt change that the Reserve Bank of Australia became spooked and raised interest rates by a quarter point to 3.85 per cent in its February 3 meeting, citing “momentum in demand”, easing financial conditions and an unemployment rate “a little lower than expected”. Does that sound familiar?
> There is also concern in Australia that the government’s budget deficit has risen to unsustainable levels. The IMF this week welcomed a planned medium-term fiscal consolidation — but Australia’s deficit is currently rising. Of course, the country’s expected budget deficit of around 3 per cent of GDP in 2025 and 2026 is less than half that of the US (which, as the Congressional Budget Office last week forecast, is expected to remain high for the next decade).
> Some content could not load. Check your internet connection or browser settings.
> It is best not to assume the US in the future will look like Australia. Economies are different. But equally, the days in which the Fed cut interest rates to reflect potential downside risks to the US labour market seem to be over.
> Harvard University’s Jason Furman delivered a beautiful economic lecture on the FT’s opinion pages, showing that higher productivity growth generally does not mean lower inflation and rates.
> Staying in the US, Stephen Cecchetti and Kim Schoenholtz argue that Fed chair nominee Kevin Warsh should tread carefully when trying to rein in the central bank’s balance sheet.
> In Munich at the weekend, ECB president Christine Lagarde announced that Euro swap lines would be available to any country except bad actors on a permanent basis. The move contained an important message about euro stability, but I cannot conceive of a stressed situation in which the ECB would have refused a swap line that had been requested from a trusted partner.
> Staying with the ECB, executive board member Isabel Schnabel made a strong case for smashing multiple regulations across the continent with a 28th regime.
> High inflation is undermining Turkey’s success in producing TV dramas.
> When someone (most often in the US or UK) next tells you that Eurozone interest rates will always be too high for Mediterranean members and too low for the Nordics, show them this chart.
> For decades Spain had a big unemployment problem while Finland’s joblessness rate was close to the best in the Eurozone. No longer. Spain now has a lower unemployment rate than Finland. When they’re feeling resentful, you could forgive the Spanish for thinking the Finns should just get out of the sauna and do some work.
> Does this prove the Eurozone to be an optimal currency area? Not really. But it does show that a single interest rate does not prevent fortunes changing significantly between members.

### 1. [Western cyber alliances risk fragmenting in new world order](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366639044/Western-cyber-alliances-risk-fragmenting-in-new-world-order)
**Source**: Computer Weekly | **Date**: 2026-02-17T17:38:00+00:00

> The global cyber threat landscape was defined by fragmentation in 2025, driven in no small part by widening geopolitical fractures that threatened the 80-year-old rules-based international order that has kept the peace – at least in the global north – since the end of the Second World War, according to a report.
> In a cyber threat report published last week, Recorded Future’s Insikt Group explored how the conduct of powerful nations – aptly demonstrated by the possibility of a unilateral US takeover of Greenland, threatening the integrity of the Nato alliance – is causing knock-on effects in the cyber world as long-standing security frameworks appear increasingly precarious.
> Indeed, in some circumstances, legal ambiguity around US actions, particularly those taking place in the Caribbean and Venezuela, has in fact caused some of America’s core allies, including the UK, to restrict intelligence sharing. Recorded Future said that strained transatlantic relations were limiting coordinated responses to wider crises such as Russia’s four-year war on Ukraine, and that these geopolitical dynamics are directly shaping state behaviour in cyberspace.
> Meanwhile, sustained law enforcement pressure led to some big wins last year in the form of disruptions and takedowns of cyber criminal infrastructure, along with arrests, but this is now resulting in a more decentralised, modular criminal ecosystem that, unfortunately, is also more resilient.
> And on the technological front, this fragmentation was demonstrated by the growing split between China and the US as the two great powers vie for AI dominance.
> “In 2025, Insikt Group tracked how cyber activity shifted from a primary focus on espionage toward increased use of cyber capabilities for signalling, coercion and disruption in both kinetic conflicts and grey-zone scenarios,” said the report’s authors.
> “Securing access to identity systems, cloud environments and edge infrastructure emerged as a central feature of interstate competition, reflecting the growing strategic value of persistent digital access and pre-positioning.
> “Disruption was equally visible in the information environment. Insikt Group observed hacktivist groups, patriotic volunteers and influence networks playing a growing role in conflicts involving Israel-Iran, India-Pakistan, Thailand-Cambodia, and Russia-Ukraine.
> “These actors operated with varying degrees of state alignment, but consistently contributed to a threat landscape in which genuine intrusions, exaggerated claims and disinformation reinforced one another,” they said.
> Speaking at the report’s launch at the annual Munich Security Conference in Germany, Recorded Future chief security and intelligence officer Levi Gundert said: “Uncertainty is no longer episodic – it’s the operating environment.
> “As geopolitical norms weaken, state objectives, criminal capability and private-sector technology are increasingly reinforcing one another, compressing warning timelines and expanding plausible deniability. AI is accelerating that dynamic, not through autonomous attacks, but by scaling deception and eroding trust inside decision-making processes.
> “In 2026, cyber risk will be defined less by singular events and more by persistent, fragmented pressure that reshapes competition, escalation, and stability over time.”
> Against these general dynamics, Recorded Future said cyber operations are now becoming established as a routine tool of geopolitical competition, alongside more traditional instruments such as sanctions, tariffs or asset seizures.
> “The cumulative effect is an international system with higher tolerance for risk and fewer constraints on escalation. For governments and businesses alike, resilience rather than stability is now the baseline operating assumption,” the team said.
> This year, the report said, state-sponsored cyber operations will coalesce around low-visibility access and reconnaissance operations as a precursor to outright conflict, said Recorded Future co-founder Christopher Ahlberg.
> “Cyber operations are no longer preparation for conflict – they are part of conflict. What we’re seeing is that adversaries are logging in, not hacking in. This is a shift toward access, influence and leverage that can be activated at moments of political or military tension, often below the threshold of traditional response,” he said.
> Russia, said Recorded Future, will move away from malware-driven campaigns towards credential-based intrusions and the abuse of legitimate services such as identity platforms. This approach allows hackers to escalate to outright disruption while maintaining plausible deniability for their paymasters, and making it harder for security teams to detect them.
> Chinese actors, meanwhile, are likely to expand from data theft towards information operations bombarding their targets with large volumes of AI slop in a form of “flooding the zone”. According to Recorded Future’s analysts, Beijing already has established doctrines on AI-driven “psychographic targeting” with the intent of eroding its rivals’ resolve through bespoke, emotionally provocative operations that complement its underlying attacks.
> The Iranians, the report predicted, will remain largely focused on regional influence operations, with continued use of hacktivist proxies. Despite recent internal upheaval, and the US’s response to this, more widespread disruptive operations are probably unlikely, although they should not necessarily be ruled out.
> North Korea will remain an active and dangerous cyber actor, with its operations likely to continue targeting workforce infiltration to enable data theft and, critically, revenue generation going forward.
> Finally, defenders should also be on the lookout for commercial spyware, which will remain a key enabler of state-backed cyber risk. Such tools – the most infamous example being Israel-based NSO’s Pegasus malware – also muddy the waters somewhat in that they are now widely used by many governments against their own people.

### 2. [Oil Energy, India-U.S. Relations, and the Russia Conundrum](https://www.cfr.org/articles/oil-energy-india-u-s-relations-and-the-russia-conundrum)
**Source**: Council | **Date**: 2026-02-17T15:25:00+00:00

> This memo is a part of CFR Expert Manjari Chatterjee Miller’s project on India and the liberal international order published by CFR’s China Strategy Initiative through its China 360° program.
> Oil, the dominant global energy source of the twentieth century, is a structural vulnerability for India. India is the third-largest consumer of oil globally; it accounts for about one-quarter of the country’s primary energy consumption, and a similar proportion of national carbon emissions. However, owing to its limited domestic reserves, India imports nearly 87 percent of its crude oil. Coal remains the country’s most-consumed and emissions-intensive fuel source, and, in contrast, is domestically available.
> The International Energy Agency, in its World Energy Outlook 2025, projects that India will lead global oil demand growth over the next decade and account for nearly half of the incremental global increase.1 India’s oil demand is expected to rise from 5.5 million barrels per day (mbpd) in 2024 to 8 mbpd in 2035—the largest increase for any country—and to continue growing through 2050. Consequently, India’s oil import dependency is projected to increase from 87 percent in 2024 to 92 percent in 2035, despite concerted efforts on India’s part to expand domestic production.
> How India meets its growing oil demand will be consequential for its climate commitments, energy future, and geopolitical relations, especially as those choices are increasingly shaped by an evolving global order. It is thus imperative to understand India’s national interests and oil energy strategy, analyze how those global dynamics could shape India’s efforts toward energy self‑reliance, and understand where the United States and India could converge or diverge on energy priorities.
> India’s twenty-first century energy policy and transition are driven by domestic energy security. With more than 40 percent of its primary energy needs currently met through imports, India aims to achieve energy self‑reliance by 2047, the centenary of its independence.2 To this end, it has adopted a pragmatic all‑of‑the‑above approach focused on expanding domestic production, pursuing alternative energy resources, and diversifying its sources of oil.
> India’s oil strategy thus takes a multipronged approach to reduce crude oil import dependence and mitigate the geopolitical risks of supply chokepoints. This strategy includes the following dimensions.
> To expand domestic oil exploration (to meet rising demand and reduce crude oil import dependence)3, the Indian government opened in 2022 approximately one million square kilometres of previously restricted offshore areas for exploration and introduced incentives such as lower royalty rates, zero revenue-sharing requirements, and other regulatory relaxations to accelerate investment and production.4 However, India has still seen a 2.5 percent drop in domestic crude oil production in 2024–25.5 Its oil wells have seen a sustained fall in output as they age, resulting in a 26 percent drop in annual crude production over the past decade.
> Therefore, to meet its projected demand and improve its energy security, India has begun expanding its oil-sector infrastructure. New strategic petroleum reserves are planned to hold crude oil for up to ninety days of consumption.6 In parallel, India aims to expand its refining capacity by 20 percent, reaching 309 million metric tonnes a year by 2030.7
> Further, India is pursuing alternative fuels such as ethanol, natural gas, biofuels, and electricity for electric vehicles (EVs). The country achieved 20 percent ethanol blending in petrol in 2025, five years ahead of the original 2030 target.8 In parallel, EVs accounted for 8 percent share of new vehicle registration in 2025, with a 30 percent target by 2030 supported by government incentives for manufacturers and buyers.9 Together, those measures have played a significant role in moderating the growth of India’s oil import demand.
> Finally, India is actively diversifying its oil import sources to mitigate geopolitical risks and external vulnerabilities. India has adopted a largely pragmatic approach to oil energy security as a fast‑growing economy. However, geopolitical tensions and supply‑chain disruptions have reshaped national oil strategies. For example, the Russia-Ukraine war has precipitated one of the most significant reconfigurations of global oil flows in recent decades.
> Over the past two decades, India has taken steps to broaden its supplier base substantially, expanding from twenty-seven to over forty countries.10 During the 2000s, West Asia—particularly Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates—remained the dominant source accounting for over two-thirds of India’s crude imports. Between 2005 and 2015, India began gradually diversifying by sourcing oil from Africa ( Angola and Nigeria) and Latin America (Mexico and Venezuela).11 Following 2010, UN and U.S. sanctions on Iran’s oil compelled India to reduce Iranian oil, cutting its share from over 10 percent to negligible levels by 2020, thereby accelerating diversification efforts. As a result, the United States emerged as one of India’s top ten suppliers by 2018–19, while Russia remained a negligible contributor until 2022.
> But after the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war in 2022, India increasingly turned to Russia for its crude oil imports. This move became a source of conflict between the United States and India, which accelerated after President Donald Trump returned to office in 2025.
> Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine shocked the international system. The United States and European Union imposed sanctions on Russia to economically isolate it by constraining its oil exports. India stayed neutral, calling only for an immediate end to hostilities and a diplomatic resolution. Citing its strategic autonomy, India neither condemned Russia (an important strategic partner) nor downgraded its economic cooperation with Ukraine.
> India did, however, diverge from the United States and its Western partners by significantly increasing its imports of Russian crude oil.
> Prior to its invasion, Russian crude accounted for below 1 percent of India’s oil imports. However, following the oil sanctions imposed by the Group of Seven, the EU, and the United States, Russia offered substantial discounts to Asian buyers, attracting India’s interest. Russia became India’s largest crude oil supplier, with Indian refineries readily absorbing discounted barrels. Long‑standing India-Russia trade and defense ties—combined with the development of alternative shipping, insurance, and payment mechanisms—facilitated that rapid expansion. As a result, Russia’s share of India’s crude oil imports surged to 21.6 percent in 2022–23, 35.9 percent in 2023–24, and 35.8 percent in 2024–25.
> India has justified its Russian crude oil purchases as in the best interest of its citizens by securing lower‑cost crude. But the shift has also strengthened India’s position as a major exporter of petroleum products. India today ranks among the world’s leading petroleum product exporters, refining crude sourced from diverse suppliers and supplying fuels globally with Europe, a key destination. In 2023–24, India exported 30 percent of the petrol, 24 percent of the diesel, 28 percent of the naphtha, and 50 percent of the aviation fuel it produced.12 Access to discounted Russian crude significantly amplified this export capacity: India’s petroleum product exports to Europe rose from 9,741 metric tonnes in 2018–19 to 24.73 million metric tons in 2023–24.13 The initial surge was trigged by a pandemic-related spike, but the momentum was sustained by access to discounted Russian crude, reinforcing India’s ambition to emerge as a refining hub.14 Although the precise share of oil used for refining is unclear, Europe’s import of Indian petroleum products jumped 46 percent between 2022–23 and 2023–24, illustrating the scale.
> In response, the United States has leveraged ongoing trade negotiations to pressure India over its purchases of Russian oil. In an executive order issued by President Trump on August 6, 2025, the United States imposed an additional 25 percent tariff on Indian exports on top of an existing reciprocal 25 percent tariff.15 Since then, Trump has repeatedly threatened to raise those tariffs to 500 percent should India continue importing Russian crude.
> India has pushed back against the tariffs and associated threats, calling them “unfair, unjustifiable and unreasonable,”16and accusing the United States and EU of double standards (the two continue to import substantial volumes of Russian goods).17 It has defended its position by arguing that it seeks the “best deal,” and to “safeguard the interests of the Indian consumer in a volatile energy scenario.”18 However, given its longstanding collaboration with Russia in defense, nuclear energy, and space exploration, and the Indian government’s consciousness of its security and energy interests, India has historically refrained from criticizing Russia. This pattern is unlikely to change.
> Amid this exchange, sustained U.S. pressure —combined with risks to parallel trade negotiations between the two countries—appears to have had some influence: in December 2025, India’s oil imports from Russia dropped to their lowest level in thirty-eight months, even as imports of U.S. oil increased by 31 percent year over year.19
> On February 02, 2026, India and the United States announced a long-anticipated trade agreement.20 Trump claimed that India had agreed to stop importing Russian crude and would instead buy from United States and potentially Venezuela. However, India has not officially confirmed any such commitment. Rather, its position, as stated by the spokesperson for the Ministry of External Affairs, remains consistent:
> [Ensuring] the energy security of 1.4 billion Indians is the supreme priority of our government. Diversifying our energy sourcing in keeping with objective market conditions and evolving international dynamics is at the core of our strategy to ensure this. All of India’s decisions were taken and will be taken with this in mind… Consistent with our approach to energy security, India remains open to exploring the commercial merits of any crude supply options, including Venezuela.21
> Even as India hails the prospect of a cut in U.S. tariffs to 18 percent, questions remain over its capacity and willingness to fulfill the conditions attached to the proposed deal.22
> Energy imports are not mere commercial or technical considerations. For India, import-dependence continues to hinge on navigating unpredictable geopolitical realities while ensuring favorable economic outcomes for its citizens.
> India has increasingly positioned itself as a major actor in global energy geopolitics, shaped by its energy import relations, export ambitions, and an expanding clean-energy agenda. Over the past three decades, the United States has been a strong energy partner for India. Beyond intelligence-sharing, technical cooperation, and sustained bilateral dialogues, the United States is India’s fifth-largest supplier of crude oil and second-largest supplier of liquified natural gas, and a key partner in nuclear energy and critical minerals. Even amid current tensions, India has acknowledged a “very high element” of U.S. involvement in its domestic energy security goals and its reliance on the United States for critical energy resources.23
> However, conflict over India’s oil import strategy has long been an issue between the two countries, and it did not begin with Russia. Throughout the 2010s, India repeatedly reduced its crude oil imports from Iran under U.S. pressure. For a long time, Iran had been one of India’s top three oil suppliers, accounting for more than 10 percent of its crude imports. India even invested in refinery infrastructure designed to process Iranian crude. Under pressure from the Obama administration and the first Trump administration, India scaled down Iranian crude purchases to negligible level by 2019.24 Similarly, U.S. sanctions on Venezuelan oil complicated transactions for Indian refiners by increasing compliance risks and creating shipping and payment constraints.25 Despite investments by Indian public‑sector oil companies—Indian Oil and ONGC Videsh—in Venezuela’s oil sector, that country’s share of India’s crude oil imports declined from 6.7 percent in 2018 to just 0.3 percent in 2025.
> Although the present tensions between India and the United States reflect certain dynamics unique to the Trump administration, the sources of pressure and contention extend well beyond it. This has been shaped in part by the United States’ perception of its strategic altruism and lack of reciprocity from India, as well as India’s desire to preserve its strategic autonomy and pursue its national interests and accompanying domestic energy needs.26
> The 2025 U.S. oil sanctions were distinguished by the intensity and credibility of their enforcement.27 The use of secondary sanctions proved particularly effective in deterring third‑country entities from facilitating the flow of sanctioned oil. As a rapidly growing oil consumer, India benefited from Russia’s discounted crude, which helped the government maintain relative stability in retail fuel prices during electoral cycles. However, as India has yielded to U.S. pressure, it now faces rising exposure to more expensive, non‑sanctioned oil imports. India could absorb the cost of this transition, as long as alternative crude oil sources remain available.28
> The India-U.S. rift of 2025 underscores the renewed political and economic significance of oil flows, despite global efforts to transition away from fossil fuels. Sanctions are likely to remain a preferred tool for the United States; India, for its part, will diversify its crude oil basket without entirely forgoing access to discounted barrels. In an increasingly demand-driven global oil market, India—leading incremental demand growth—is likely to assert greater autonomy in shaping its energy security strategy.
> Nonetheless, while such tensions could become a recurrent feature of bilateral engagement, both countries continue to place high value on their broader strategic and energy partnership. India could be a credible alternative to China for clean technology for the United States and the EU. From India’s perspective, access to U.S. and EU markets is critical to realizing its manufacturing ambitions. The rapid expansion of India’s solar module manufacturing industry, for instance, has been driven in part by U.S. demand, which accounts for nearly 90 percent of India’s solar module exports.
> Despite tensions over oil and policy uncertainty, the India-U.S. relationship has demonstrated notable continuity in areas such as nuclear energy, initiatives for cleaning fossil fuel, clean technology collaboration, and transmission grid optimization.29 India’s ambitious target of achieving 100 GW of nuclear capacity by 2047 will require sustained U.S. partnership in reactor technology and nuclear fuel supply, while simultaneously generating commercial opportunities for U.S. firms.30 As both countries anticipate retaining fossil fuel assets for several decades, emissions‑reduction measures and associated technologies remain a shared priority for interim climate action. Clean technology innovation and transmission grid optimization are also largely insulated from differences in national fuel preferences. Although high‑level bilateral initiatives have fluctuated with changes in political regimes, private‑sector partnerships and nongovernmental collaborations have proven more resilient, maintaining momentum despite shifts in domestic politics.
> Whether India will treat the current tensions as a diplomatic skirmish that it can outmaneuver remains to be seen. Regardless, India will need to fundamentally recalibrate toward energy sovereignty. Accordingly, the Modi government has set a goal of achieving energy self‑sufficiency by 2047. Realizing this objective will likely predispose India toward three core domestic policy priorities.
> First, defying the projections, India will likely seek to reduce demand for oil by pursuing other fuel sources. Beyond scaling up locally available alternative fuels, this will require a fundamental reorientation of its transport sector strategy: expanding public transportation, accelerating the transition to electric vehicles and the electrification of freight, and deploying charging infrastructure that is both grid‑responsive and aligned with renewable energy integration.
> Second, despite efforts at demand substitution and domestic exploration, India is likely to depend on oil imports for the foreseeable future. Beyond diversifying its suppliers to enhance security and mitigate geopolitical disruptions—as China has done—India should also invest in overseas oil and gas assets. India has made a constructive start through ONGC Videsh Ltd, which holds equity stakes in thirty-two oil and gas projects across fifteen countries.31 Going forward, those investments need to be scaled up through partnerships with friendly countries and multinational energy companies.
> Finally, India requires an industrial policy that reinforces those strategic priorities. Becoming a global refining hub not only subjects India to heightened geopolitical scrutiny, but also introduces vulnerabilities into its domestic energy security.32 It remains to be seen whether a revamped industrial policy will successfully prioritize building manufacturing capacity around clean transportation technologies, aligning competitiveness with long‑term energy sovereignty goals.

### 3. [At Least 14 Killed in Spate of Attacks in Northwest Pakistan](https://english.aawsat.com/world/5241664-least-14-killed-spate-attacks-northwest-pakistan)
**Source**: Asharq Al-Awsat | **Date**: 2026-02-17T06:38:00+00:00

> Two bomb attacks and a gunfight between police and militants in northwest Pakistan killed at least 11 security personnel and three civilians, including a child, a security official said.
> The separate incidents on Monday in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, which left at least 25 others wounded, come as Pakistan's security forces battle intensifying insurgencies in southern and northern provinces that border Afghanistan.
> This month the ISIS group claimed responsibility for a massive suicide blast at a mosque in the capital Islamabad that killed at least 31 people, with 169 more wounded.
> Speaking on condition of anonymity, the security official told AFP that on Monday evening a suicide bomber rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into the wall of a religious college in the tribal district of Bajaur in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
> "As a result, eight police and Frontier Corps personnel present inside the seminary were martyred and 10 others injured," he said.
> "The blast also caused the roofs of several nearby houses to collapse, killing a child."
> He added the death told may rise.
> In another attack in the town of Bannu, a bomb planted in a rickshaw exploded at the Miryan police station, killing two civilians and wounding 17 others, the official said.
> Elsewhere, three police personnel and three militants were also killed during a search operation in Shangla district.
> The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa police force said in a statement, also late on Monday, that the three militants who died in the firefight had been involved in "attacks targeting Chinese nationals".
> Beijing has poured billions of dollars into Pakistan in recent years, but Chinese-funded projects have sparked resentment and their citizens have frequently come under attack.
> In March last year, five Chinese nationals working on a major dam construction site were killed along with their driver when a suicide bomber targeted their vehicle, which plunged into a deep ravine off the mountainous Karakoram Highway.
> Beijing is Islamabad's closest regional ally, readily providing financial assistance to bail out its often struggling neighbor.
> The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) has seen tens of billions of dollars funneled into massive transport, energy and infrastructure projects -- part of Beijing's transnational "Belt and Road" scheme.
> The police statement said "due to the area's proximity to the Silk Road route, (the militants) posed a persistent threat to the strategic road corridor and Chinese development projects."
> "In light of this, the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) and the district police launched a joint operation today under a coordinated strategy."
> Iranians shouted slogans against Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei on Tuesday as they gathered to commemorate protesters killed in a crackdown on nationwide demonstrations that rights groups said left thousands dead, according to videos verified by AFP.
> The country's clerical authorities also staged a commemoration in the capital Tehran to mark the 40th day since the deaths at the peak of the protests on January 8 and 9.
> Officials acknowledge more than 3,000 people died during the unrest, but attribute the violence to "terrorist acts", while rights groups say many more thousands of people were killed, shot dead by security forces in a violent crackdown.
> The protests, sparked by anger over the rising cost of living before exploding in size and anti-government fervor, subsided after the crackdown, but in recent days Iranians have chanted slogans from the relative safety of homes and rooftops at night.
> On Tuesday, videos verified by AFP showed crowds gathering at memorials for some of those killed again shouting slogans against the theocratic government in place since the 1979 revolution.
> In videos geolocated by AFP shared on social media, a crowd in Abadan in western Iran holds up flowers and commemorative photos of a young man as they shout "death to Khamenei" and "long live the shah", in support of the ousted monarchy.
> Another video from the same city shows people running in panic from the sounds of shots, though it wasn't immediately clear if they were from live fire.
> In the northeastern city of Mashhad a crowd in the street chanted, "One person killed, thousands have his back", another verified video showed.
> Gatherings also took place in other parts of the country, according to videos shared by rights groups.
> At the government-organized memorial in Tehran crowds carried Iranian flags and portraits of those killed as nationalist songs played and chants of "Death to America" and "Death to Israel" echoed through the Khomeini Grand Mosalla mosque.
> Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian attended a similar event at the Imam Reza shrine in Mashhad.
> Authorities have accused sworn enemies the United States and Israel of fueling "foreign-instigated riots", saying they hijacked peaceful protests with killings and vandalism.
> Senior officials, including First Vice President Mohammad Reza Aref and Revolutionary Guards commander Esmail Qaani, attended the ceremony.
> "Those who supported rioters and terrorists are criminals and will face the consequences," Qaani said, according to Tasnim news agency.
> International organizations have said evidence shows Iranian security forces targeted protesters with live fire under the cover of an internet blackout.
> The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) has recorded more than 7,000 killings in the crackdown, the vast majority protesters, though rights groups warn the toll is likely far higher.
> More than 53,500 people have been arrested in the ongoing crackdown, HRANA added, with rights groups warning protesters could face execution.
> Tuesday's gatherings coincided with a second round of nuclear negotiations between Iran and the United States in Geneva, amid heightened tensions after Washington deployed an aircraft carrier group to the Middle East following Iran's crackdown on the protests.
> An ‌independent United Nations body on Tuesday condemned what it described as vicious attacks based on disinformation by several European ministers against the organization's special rapporteur for Palestine, Francesca Albanese.
> In the past week several European countries, including Germany, France and Italy, called for Albanese’s resignation over her alleged criticism of Israel. Albanese, an Italian lawyer, denies making the remarks.
> On Friday, the Czech Republic's Foreign Minister Petr Macinka quoted Albanese on X as having called Israel a "common enemy of humanity", and he ‌also called for ‌her resignation.
> A transcript of Albanese's remarks ‌made ⁠in Doha on ⁠February 7 seen by Reuters did not characterize Israel in this way, although she has consistently criticized the country in the past over the Gaza conflict.
> The UN Coordination Committee - a body of six independent experts which coordinates and facilitates the work of Special Rapporteurs - accused European ministers of relying on "manufactured ⁠facts".
> "Instead of demanding Ms. Albanese's resignation ‌for performing her mandate...these government representatives ‌should join forces to hold accountable, including before the International Criminal Court, ‌leaders and officials accused of committing war crimes and ‌crimes against humanity in Gaza," the Committee said.
> It said the pressure exerted on Albanese was part of an increasing trend of politically motivated and malicious attacks against independent human rights experts, UN officials ‌and judges of international courts.
> US President Donald Trump's administration imposed sanctions on Albanese after she wrote ⁠letters ⁠to US companies accusing them of contributing to gross human rights violations by Israel in Gaza and the West Bank.
> UN experts are commissioned by the Geneva-based Human Rights Council to monitor and document specific human rights crises but are independent of the organization itself.
> There is no precedent for removing a special rapporteur during their term, although diplomats said that states on the 47-member council could in theory propose a motion to do so.
> However, they said strong support for Palestinian rights within the body means that such a motion was unlikely to pass.
> The United States plans to deploy more high-tech missile systems to the Philippines to help deter aggression in the South China Sea, where the treaty allies on Tuesday condemned what they called China’s "illegal, coercive, aggressive, and deceptive activities."
> Beijing has repeatedly expressed alarm over the installation in the northern Philippines of a US mid-range missile system called the Typhon in 2024 and of an anti-ship missile launcher last year. It said the US weapons were aimed at containing China’s rise and warned that these were a threat to regional stability.
> China has asked the Philippines to withdraw the missile launchers from its territory, but officials led by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. have rejected the demand.
> US and Philippine officials held annual talks Monday in Manila on broadening security, political and economic engagements and boosting collaboration with regional security allies.
> The US and the Philippines outlined in a joint statement Tuesday specific defense and security plans for this year, including joint military exercises, Washington's support to help modernize the Philippine military and efforts "to increase deployments of US cutting-edge missile and unmanned systems to the Philippines."
> The longtime allies "underscored their support for preserving freedom of navigation and overflight, unimpeded lawful commerce and other lawful uses of the sea for all nations," the statement said.
> "Both sides condemned China’s illegal, coercive, aggressive and deceptive activities in the South China Sea, recognizing their adverse effects on regional peace and stability and the economies of the Indo-Pacific and beyond," it added.
> Confrontations between Chinese and Philippine coast guard forces have spiked in the disputed waters in recent years. Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan are also involved in the territorial standoffs.
> Neither side elaborated on the planned missile deployments but Philippine ambassador to Washington, Jose Manuel Romualdez, who took part in Monday’s talks, said US and Filipino defense officials discussed the possible deployment this year of "upgraded" types of US missile launchers that the Philippines may eventually decide to purchase.
> "It’s a kind of system that’s really very sophisticated and will be deployed here in the hope that, down the road, we will be able to get our own," Romualdez told The Associated Press.
> The Typhon missile system that the US Army deployed to the main northern Philippine region of Luzon in April 2024 and an anti-missile launcher called the Navy Marine Expeditionary Ship Interdiction System that was deployed in April last year also to Luzon have remained in the Philippines, Romualdez said.
> During joint drills, US forces have exhibited the missile systems to batches of Filipino forces to familiarize them with the weapons’ capabilities and usage, military officials said.
> Romualdez said the US missile deployments to the Philippines did not aim to antagonize any country.
> "It’s purely for deterrence," he said. "Every time the Chinese show any kind of aggression, it only strengthens our resolve to have these types."
> The Typhon missile launchers, a land-based weapon, can fire the Standard Missile-6 and the Tomahawk Land Attack Missile. Tomahawk missiles can travel over 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers), which places China within their target range, from the northern Philippine region of Luzon.
> Last year, the US Marines deployed the anti-ship missile launcher, the Navy Marine Expeditionary Ship Interdiction System, to Batan island in the northernmost Philippine province of Batanes, which faces the Bashi Channel just south of Taiwan.
> The sea passage is a critical trade and military route that the US and Chinese militaries have tried to gain strategic control of.

### 4. [India, the United States, and Diverging Climate and Energy Norms](https://www.cfr.org/articles/india-the-united-states-and-diverging-climate-and-energy-norms)
**Source**: Council | **Date**: 2026-02-17T15:26:00+00:00

> The Trump administration has just announced it will revoke a policy from the Obama era that declared carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases a threat to public health and welfare. That declaration of endangerment had served as the legal foundation for almost all climate regulations put in place since 1970 by the Clear Air Act, which regulates many sources of pollution such as power plants and motor vehicles.
> The revocation aligns with the administration’s skeptical approach to climate and energy norms. President Donald Trump has himself called climate change a “hoax” and green energy a “scam.” Since he took office in January 2025, the U.S. government has centered its climate and energy policy on expanding fossil fuel production while rolling back climate regulations and renewable energy support. The Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025, following the principle that Biden-era climate regulations “[impoverished] Americans and [made] China rich,” provided the Trump administration with a blueprint for such policies: nearly two-thirds of Trump’s early executive actions mirrored proposals from Project 2025.
> The U.S. volte-face on climate and energy norms and global leadership has implications not just for the liberal international order but for countries such as India that have, in the past, been themselves recalcitrant on such norms. Today, particularly in comparison with the United States, India seems positively forward-facing, making an astonishing pivot on previous climate and energy policies while at the same time emphasizing its national and security interests. This turnaround has also led to tension with the Trump administration—particularly on oil energy and India’s reliance on Russian oil.
> On February 6, the United States announced a trade deal with India. The Trump administration declared that it would lower tariffs on Indian goods down to 18 percent from the original 50 percent and, in turn, India would commit to stop oil imports from Russia. Yet no such commitment was forthcoming from the Modi government. In past years, climate cooperation with India received bipartisan support in the United States. Even under the first Trump administration, the United States and India had cooperated on energy security, which included cooperation on renewables as a source of clean energy. The future of such cooperation is now increasingly uncertain as the two countries diverge on the path forward.
> The following Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) memos by experts from three countries are part of a larger CFR project assessing India’s approach to the international order in different areas. The papers consider India’s position on important issues in the climate and energy order: climate diplomacy, oil energy, and carbon emissions.
> Karthik Nachiappan (Singapore) argues that India’s climate diplomacy—selectively engaging with UN Framework Convention on Climate Change processes while separately mobilizing finance, technology, and market access for decarbonization without constraining its economic growth or energy access—stands in sharp contrast to the United States’. Their differing stances raise broader questions about the future of multilateral climate institutions, the relevance of equity as a climate norm, and the need for global leadership in an increasingly geoeconomic climate order.
> Ashwini Swain (India) argues that India’s energy policy and transition are driven by its domestic energy security needs. Due to limited domestic reserves, India has to import nearly 87 percent of its crude oil. While it is pursuing alternative fuels, it is also diversifying its oil imports to hedge its geopolitical bets. Today, Russia, a negligible source prior to the Russia-Ukraine war that began in 2022, has become its largest crude oil supplier. Despite the tensions this has created with the United States, India is unlikely to rapidly diverge from this path.
> Clara Gillispie (United States) contends that India is in the middle of a revolutionary energy transition, attempting to pull off what other countries such as the United States have done over decades in a very short time frame. Its approach is that of climate realism—moving aggressively on climate action while recognizing both its economic and geopolitical interests and structural constraints. Thus, although it continues to rely on coal, India is also setting—and exceeding, in cases—aggressive targets for deploying renewable energy technologies.

## 📌 Topic: China's Economic Slowdown
*(Found 3 articles)*

### 1. [Ghana's Timber Exports Drop 20% to Six-Year Low in 2025](https://www.ecofinagency.com/news-agriculture/1702-52993-ghana-s-timber-exports-drop-20-to-six-year-low-in-2025)
**Source**: Ecofin Agency | **Date**: 2026-02-17T15:11:00+00:00

> Ghana exported 217,000 cubic meters of wood and wood products in 2025, a 20% decline from the 273,000 cubic meters shipped the previous year, according to data compiled by the Timber Industry Development Division (TIDD) in a report published Sunday, Feb. 15.
> Export revenues also fell 21% year-on-year to 98.38 million euros (approximately $116.3 million). The TIDD described it as the weakest export performance by Ghana's timber industry in six years, both in volume and value.
> The report does not detail the reasons behind the underperformance, though several factors may have contributed to the downturn. In a market analysis published in October 2025, the specialized platform GlobalWood said the timber sector in West and Central Africa was ending the year under significant pressure due to internal financial difficulties and a sharp slowdown in international demand. “Global demand remains sluggish: the persistent slowdown in China, competition from Brazilian softwoods and a stagnant European market are jointly limiting export growth for African producers,” GlobalWood said at the time.
> A downward trend underway since 2023
> After steady growth from 2020, Ghana’s timber industry reached a record 343,000 cubic meters of wood and wood products exported in 2022, valued at 153.88 million euros. Exports began to decline in 2023, falling nearly 15% that year, and the downward trend continued through 2025.
> In total, between 2020 and 2025, Ghana shipped approximately 1.66 million cubic meters of wood products for a cumulative value of 763.07 million euros, according to TIDD data. Air-dried sawn wood was the leading export, accounting for roughly 55% of volumes, followed by kiln-dried sawn wood (14%), plywood (11%) and logs (10%). Together, those four product categories represented 89% of total export volume over the period and 83% of revenues.
> Teak, wawa/ayous, eucalyptus, cedrela and gmelina were the main species exported, primarily to Asian markets. The TIDD said Asia absorbed 63% of Ghana’s exports in 2025, followed by Europe (17%), Africa (13%), the Americas (4%) and the Middle East (3%).
> Despite the overall decline in exports in 2025, exports to African markets showed signs of improvement. After falling from 13% of Ghana’s sales in 2020 to 9% in 2024, that share edged back up to 11% in 2025.
> According to the TIDD, the rebound was driven mainly by markets within the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), where purchases rose 7% in volume to 19,771 cubic meters, led primarily by plywood, which accounted for the bulk of regional shipments. Other products exported to the region included sawn wood, sliced veneer and poles. Togo, Burkina Faso and Gambia were the most active buyers, mainly of plywood.
> In this context, President John Dramani Mahama, speaking at the Africa Trade Summit 2026 in Accra, called for deeper regional value chains to reduce African economies’ dependence on external markets and strengthen local industrial competitiveness. For Ghana, the uptick in regional demand offers a positive signal as the forestry sector seeks to revive exports while meeting growing sustainability requirements.

### 2. [Top Nigerian Newspaper Headlines For Today, Tuesday, 17th February, 2026](https://www.naijanews.com/2026/02/17/top-nigerian-newspaper-headlines-for-today-tuesday-17th-february-2026/)
**Source**: Naija News | **Date**: 2026-02-17T03:01:00+00:00

> The Defence Headquarters (DHQ) on Monday confirmed the arrival of about 100 United States military personnel and equipment in Nigeria to support capacity building for the Armed Forces of Nigeria.
> According to military authorities, the trainers arrived at the Bauchi Airfield under a bilateral defence cooperation arrangement between Nigeria and the United States, following a formal request by the Federal Government.
> The DHQ explained that the deployment was agreed upon during a joint working group engagement between Nigerian and U.S. officials.
> The engagement, it said, focused on addressing specific training needs, technical support requirements, and intelligence-sharing gaps within the Armed Forces of Nigeria.
> Military authorities clarified that the visiting personnel are technical specialists serving strictly in advisory and training capacities.
> Nigeria’s inflation rate has reduced slightly to 15.10% in January 2026, down from 15.15% recorded in December 2025.
> Naija News reports that this is based on the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) report released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Monday.
> According to the report, the marginal decline of 0.05 percentage points suggests a continued slowdown in price pressures at the start of the year, following several months of easing inflation.
> On a year-on-year basis, inflation dropped significantly compared to the same period last year. The January 2026 rate of 15.10% is 12.51 percentage points lower than the 27.61% recorded in January 2025.
> The NBS explained that the marginal slowdown is based on changes to its price measurement framework introduced in its previous report, noting that the revised approach was designed to better capture prevailing market conditions.
> The Federal Government has charged former Kaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai, before the Federal High Court in Abuja over the alleged unlawful interception of phone communications belonging to the National Security Adviser (NSA) , Nuhu Ribadu.
> Court documents indicated that El-Rufai, 65, appeared as a guest on Arise TV’s Prime Time Programme on February 13, 2026, where he reportedly admitted involvement in the interception and acknowledged knowing those who carried out the act without reporting them to security agencies.
> The charges, filed under reference number TABU DET CR/99/2026, contain three counts.
> Count One alleges that El-Rufai admitted during the television interview that he and his associates unlawfully intercepted the phone communications of the National Security Adviser, contrary to Section 12(1) of the Cybercrimes (Prohibition, Prevention, etc.) Amendment Act, 2024.
> Count Two accuses him of stating that he knew individuals who unlawfully intercepted the same communications but failed to report them, in violation of Section 27(b) of the same Act.
> Count Three alleges that he used technical systems to compromise public safety and national security and instilled apprehension among Nigerians, contrary to Section 131(2) of the Nigerian Communications Act, 2003.
> The case was filed by a team of Federal Government lawyers led by ME Ernest, OM Owan, UM Bulla, CS Eze and VE G. Orubor.
> Protesters on Monday returned to the National Assembly, demanding that real-time electronic transmission of election results be made mandatory in the Electoral Act Amendment Bill, 2026.
> The demonstrators, comprising civil society organisations including Situation Room and Action Aid, insisted that manual collation be completely eliminated to prevent manipulation during the collation of results.
> Security operatives barricaded entrances to the National Assembly complex, forcing the protesters to stage their demonstration outside the main gates.
> The protest followed a five-day break from the Assembly after assurances given during last Tuesday’s plenary.
> The demonstrators maintained that there was no justification for retaining manual backups, arguing that the election budget already makes provision for technological infrastructure.
> Insisting on full transparency, the protesters called for mandatory real-time electronic transmission of results from polling units to the Independent National Electoral Commission’s Result Viewing Portal.
> They argued that allowing manual collation as a fallback option could create loopholes for manipulation.
> Politician and veteran Nollywood actor, Kenneth Okonkwo, has called on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to reschedule the 2027 general elections in the country.
> According to him, he is disappointed that INEC did not schedule all elections for 2027, including the presidential and governorship polls, to hold on the same day.
> He argued that Nigeria doesn’t have huge financial resources to accommodate the logistics involved in having elections on two different days within two weeks.
> The African Democratic Congress (ADC) chieftain added that security and economic challenges may also make it difficult for Nigerians to return to vote two weeks after voting for the first time, according to the election timetable released by INEC.
> Okonkwo therefore urged the Chairman of INEC, Prof. Joash Amupitan, to reschedule all the elections in a single day.
> He argued that this will also cut the “unacceptable budget” of ₦873b almost into half to prosecute the election.
> The Department of State Services (DSS) has revealed that it seized the passport of the former Kaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai, to prevent him from fleeing the country during an ongoing investigation.
> A top security source quoted by Vanguard said the DSS is investigating El-Rufai and his sons over their alleged involvement in the disappearance of one Abubakar Idris, better known as Dadiyata, in 2019.
> According to the source, the former Governor intended to escape to Egypt after visiting the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on Monday, and the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Crimes Commission (ICPC) on Tuesday, hence the need to seize his passport.
> Naija News reports that the disclosure follows last Thursday’s drama at the Nnamdi Azikwe International Airport, where security operatives seized El-Rufai’s passport upon his return to Nigeria.
> Nigerian media personality Toke Makinwa has explained why she no longer pays her tithe to churches.
> Naija News reports that the entrepreneur said her decision came after deep personal reflection about how money should be used to help people.
> In an interview with Chude, she shared that her views on tithing have changed over time.
> According to her, she began to question the way churches receive large sums of money while many members still struggle with basic needs such as rent, hospital bills, and daily feeding.
> She spoke about what she described as post-traumatic church syndrome, a situation where people feel hurt or damaged emotionally and spiritually because of their experiences in religious spaces.
> She said this made her look closely at how religious institutions operate and how funds are handled.
> Makinwa said she started asking herself why she should give money to church buildings that are already well funded when there are individuals who urgently need help.
> The law firm representing the babymama of Nigerian Afrobeat singer, Davido, Sophia Momodu, in the ongoing child custody case, has issued a warning to the musician and his fans following a series of public outbursts on social media.
> Naija News reports that the warning follows a series of posts on Davido’s social media, expressing frustration over what he described as “insensitive remarks regarding his deceased son” during cross-examination in court.
> In a statement released on Monday, Sophia’s legal representatives, Punuka Attorneys & Solicitors, condemned all manner of inflammatory public statements directed at their partner, Ebelechukwu Enedah, arising from her professional conduct in the custody proceedings at a Lagos State court.
> The firm stressed that the matter is sub judice and “will be decided by the court alone, on evidence and law,” warning that attempts to intimidate legal practitioners could undermine the rule of law.
> Benfica manager Jose Mourinho believes Real Madrid will arrive in Lisbon with pride bruised and revenge on their minds when the two sides meet again in the Champions League play-offs on Tuesday night.
> The Portuguese champions stunned Europe last month with a breathless 4-2 win over the 15-time European Cup winners, sealing their place in the knockout rounds dramatically. Goalkeeper Anatoliy Trubin was the unlikely hero, rising in the 98th minute to head home the winner against Thibaut Courtois at the Estadio da Luz.
> That result sent shockwaves through the competition. Madrid, who had been sitting comfortably in third, slipped to ninth in the final standings of the league phase and missed out on automatic qualification.
> Now, with another showdown looming, Mourinho has warned that the Spanish giants will not take kindly to what happened.
> The Premier League and the English Football League (EFL) will once again pause selected fixtures during Ramadan, allowing Muslim players and match officials a brief window to break their fast at sunset.
> Ramadan begins this week and lasts for a month, during which Muslims abstain from food and drink from dawn to sunset as an act of worship and reflection.
> In the United Kingdom, sunset will fall between roughly 17:00 and 19:00 GMT across the period, meaning only certain late afternoon and early evening kick-offs are likely to be affected.
> Saturday’s 17:30 GMT fixtures and Sunday’s 16:30 GMT matches could include short pauses, provided the timing aligns with sunset.
> As in previous seasons, captains and referees will identify a natural stoppage in play, such as a goal-kick, free-kick or throw-in, to allow those observing the fast to take on fluids or energy supplements. Play will not be halted in the middle of active passages.
> Clubs and match officials are expected to hold discussions before kick-off to determine whether a pause will be required and, if so, roughly when it might occur.

> It's the Year of the Fire Horse. In the Chinese zodiac, the fire horse represents action and risk-taking. But on the streets of Beijing, many say they just want stability in this sluggish economy.
> SCOTT DETROW, HOST:  Many parts of Asia are celebrating the start of the Lunar New Year tomorrow. It's the year of the fire horse. In the Chinese zodiac, the fire horse represents action and risk-taking. But on the streets of Beijing, many say they just want stability in this sluggish economy. NPR's Jennifer Pak brings us the story.JENNIFER PAK, BYLINE: At a crowded Lunar New Year market in Beijing, vendors sell a mix of goods like red lanterns, dumplings and clothing. There's a lot going on, so sellers make noises to attract customers. Here's a vendor selling toy drums.(SOUNDBITE OF TOY DRUMS)PAK: Among the shoppers is Wang Wenxin. He says this past year has been good for him.WANG WENXIN: (Non-English language spoken).PAK: "My village home was set to be knocked down for a development project," he says, "so I was compensated with a home and some money." Money-wise, he's doing all right. As for his youngest child?WANG: (Non-English language spoken).PAK: "My son is a university graduate. He's 24 and still lives at home," he says. "Of course, we can support him, but we're worried." Worried because China's youth unemployment rate is high. Almost 1 out of 6 graduates were jobless last December.UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Non-English language spoken).PAK: Further down the market, student Xie Youzi says she's pursuing a consecutive master's and doctorate. She's still a few years off from graduating and says she's not that worried about her future job prospects. But when asked how she sees the coming year...XIE YOUZI: (Non-English language spoken).PAK: She says she hopes China's economy will continue improving so that more people can find jobs.UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: (Non-English language spoken).PAK: It's been a busy year for another graduate student, surnamed Shu. He asked that NPR not use his full name because he fears speaking about the economy in less than glowing terms could result in official retaliation.SHU: (Non-English language spoken).PAK: "I've been studying and interning," he says. "My schedule has been packed, so I didn't have much time to relax or have fun last year." His hard work has paid off. Shu already has a job lined up when he graduates this year. His wish for this Lunar New Year?SHU: (Non-English language spoken).PAK: "I just hope to successfully graduate and start my job without any major surprises." In this economic climate, predictability is stability, and those who have stable jobs, like Helen Yi, who works at a bank, say they're looking for more outside of work.HELEN YI: (Laughter, non-English language spoken).PAK: "In the new lunar year, I hope to develop more hobbies and interests. I wish my life to be more fulfilling." She says she's happy with the overall direction China is taking.YI: (Non-English language spoken).PAK: "The economy is steadily progressing," she says, especially in science, technology innovation and finance. But those things don't matter much to ordinary people, says Wang Wenxin, the man whose adult son is still living with him.WANG: (Non-English language spoken).PAK: He says, "Sure, you can hail a robot taxi in Beijing's pilot zone in Yizhuang, and it's relatively easy. But that's not creating human jobs," he says. And with the retirement age raised, plus another 12 million-plus students set to graduate this year, Wang says the pressure on young people and families like his is growing. Jennifer Pak, NPR News.

> (SOUNDBITE OF TOY DRUMS)PAK: Among the shoppers is Wang Wenxin. He says this past year has been good for him.WANG WENXIN: (Non-English language spoken).PAK: "My village home was set to be knocked down for a development project," he says, "so I was compensated with a home and some money." Money-wise, he's doing all right. As for his youngest child?WANG: (Non-English language spoken).PAK: "My son is a university graduate. He's 24 and still lives at home," he says. "Of course, we can support him, but we're worried." Worried because China's youth unemployment rate is high. Almost 1 out of 6 graduates were jobless last December.UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Non-English language spoken).PAK: Further down the market, student Xie Youzi says she's pursuing a consecutive master's and doctorate. She's still a few years off from graduating and says she's not that worried about her future job prospects. But when asked how she sees the coming year...XIE YOUZI: (Non-English language spoken).PAK: She says she hopes China's economy will continue improving so that more people can find jobs.UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: (Non-English language spoken).PAK: It's been a busy year for another graduate student, surnamed Shu. He asked that NPR not use his full name because he fears speaking about the economy in less than glowing terms could result in official retaliation.SHU: (Non-English language spoken).PAK: "I've been studying and interning," he says. "My schedule has been packed, so I didn't have much time to relax or have fun last year." His hard work has paid off. Shu already has a job lined up when he graduates this year. His wish for this Lunar New Year?SHU: (Non-English language spoken).PAK: "I just hope to successfully graduate and start my job without any major surprises." In this economic climate, predictability is stability, and those who have stable jobs, like Helen Yi, who works at a bank, say they're looking for more outside of work.HELEN YI: (Laughter, non-English language spoken).PAK: "In the new lunar year, I hope to develop more hobbies and interests. I wish my life to be more fulfilling." She says she's happy with the overall direction China is taking.YI: (Non-English language spoken).PAK: "The economy is steadily progressing," she says, especially in science, technology innovation and finance. But those things don't matter much to ordinary people, says Wang Wenxin, the man whose adult son is still living with him.WANG: (Non-English language spoken).PAK: He says, "Sure, you can hail a robot taxi in Beijing's pilot zone in Yizhuang, and it's relatively easy. But that's not creating human jobs," he says. And with the retirement age raised, plus another 12 million-plus students set to graduate this year, Wang says the pressure on young people and families like his is growing. Jennifer Pak, NPR News.

Almost 1 out of 6 graduates were jobless last December.UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Non-English language spoken).PAK: Further down the market, student Xie Youzi says she's pursuing a consecutive master's and doctorate.

### 3. [AI giants are hoarding memory chips, pushing prices to hyperinflation levels](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2026-02-17/ai-giants-are-hoarding-memory-chips-pushing-prices-to-hyperinflation-levels)
**Source**: Los Angeles Times | **Date**: 2026-02-17T05:45:00+00:00

> A growing procession of tech industry leaders, including Elon Musk and Tim Cook, are warning about a global crisis in the making: A shortage of memory chips is beginning to hammer profits, derail corporate plans and inflate price tags on everything from laptops and smartphones to automobiles and data centers — and the crunch is only going to get worse.
> Since the start of 2026, Tesla Inc., Apple Inc. and a dozen other major corporations have signaled that the shortage of DRAM, or dynamic random access memory — the fundamental building block of almost all technology — will constrain production. Cook warned it will compress iPhone margins. Micron Technology Inc. called the bottleneck “unprecedented.” Musk got to the intractable nature of the problem when he declared Tesla is going to have to build its own memory fabrication plant.
> “We’ve got two choices: hit the chip wall or make a fab,” he said in late January.
> The fundamental reason for the squeeze is the buildout of AI data centers. Companies like Alphabet Inc. and OpenAI are gobbling up an increasing share of memory chip production — by buying millions of Nvidia Corp. AI accelerators that come with huge allotments of memory — to run their chatbots and other applications. That’s left consumer electronics producers fighting over a dwindling supply of chips from the likes of Samsung Electronics Co. and Micron.
> The resulting price spikes are starting to look a bit like the Weimar Republic’s hyperinflation. The cost of one type of DRAM soared 75% from December to January, accelerating price hikes throughout the holiday quarter. A growing number of retailers and middlemen are changing their prices every day. “RAMmageddon” is the term some use to describe what’s coming.
> “We stand at the cusp of something that is bigger than anything we’ve faced before,” Tim Archer, chief executive officer of chip equipment supplier Lam Research Corp., said at a conference in South Korea this month. “What is ahead of us between now and the end of this decade, in terms of demand, is bigger than anything we’ve seen in the past, and, in fact, will overwhelm all other sources of demand.”
> What’s worrying about the trend is that prices are soaring and supplies are running dry even before the AI giants really get going with their data center construction plans. Alphabet and Amazon.com Inc. just announced plans for a construction blitz this year that could reach $185 billion and $200 billion, respectively, more money than any company in history has poured into capital expenditures in a single year.
> Mark Li, a Bernstein analyst who tracks the semiconductor industry, warns that memory chip prices are going “parabolic.” While that will bring lavish profits to Samsung, Micron and SK Hynix Inc., the rest of the electronics sector will pay a painful price in the months ahead.
> “This structural imbalance between supply and demand is not simply a short-term fluctuation,” said Yang Yuanqing, the CEO of Lenovo Group Ltd., in an interview after earnings Thursday as he explained the crunch will last at least through the rest of the year.
> The disruption is threatening the profitability of entire product lines and upending long-term plans.
> Sony Group Corp. is now considering pushing back the debut of its next PlayStation console to 2028 or even 2029, according to people familiar with the company’s thinking. That would be a major upset to a carefully orchestrated strategy to sustain user engagement between hardware generations. Close rival Nintendo Co., which contributed to the surplus demand in 2025 after its new Switch 2 console drove storage card purchases, is also contemplating raising the price of that device in 2026, people familiar with its plans said. Sony and Nintendo representatives didn’t respond to requests for comment.
> A manager at a laptop maker said Samsung Electronics has recently begun reviewing its memory supply contracts every quarter or so, versus generally on an annual basis. Chinese smartphone makers including Xiaomi Corp., Oppo and Shenzhen Transsion Holdings Co. are trimming shipment targets for 2026, with Oppo cutting its forecast by as much as 20%, Chinese media outlet Jiemian reported. The companies did not respond to requests for comment.
> “Right now, we’re kind of in the middle of a storm that we are dealing with hour by hour and day by day,” Steinar Sonsteby, CEO of the Norwegian IT firm Atea ASA, told analysts in February.
> Cisco Systems Inc. cited the memory squeeze when it gave a weak profit outlook last week that led to its worst share loss in nearly four years. Qualcomm Inc. and Arm Holdings Plc both warned of more fallout ahead.
> At Sunin Plaza, the do-it-yourself PC mecca in Seoul, the usual weekday buzz has evaporated. The labyrinth of stalls, once a high-energy hub for gaming graphic cards and motherboards, is now engulfed in an eerie quiet.
> “It’s actually wiser to hold off doing business today, as prices are almost certain to be higher tomorrow,” said Suh Young-hwan, who runs three DIY PC shops in Seoul and frequently does business with stalls at Sunin Plaza. “Unless Steve Jobs rises from the dead to declare that AI is nothing but a bubble, this trend is likely to persist for some time.”
> The premium and DIY PC segment was hit hard when U.S. chipmaker Micron decided last year to end its popular Crucial brand of consumer memory sticks, after three decades in operation. Kelt Reeves, CEO and founder of custom PC maker Falcon Northwest, said Crucial’s demise started a “stampede” to secure as much inventory as they could, driving memory prices to new highs in January. Across 2025, Falcon Northwest’s average selling price rose by $1,500 to roughly $8,000 for each custom-made computer.
> All of this has echoes of one of the biggest supply chain disruptions in recent memory: the COVID-era shortages of cheap, basic auto and power chips that paralyzed automakers from Ford Motor Co. to Volkswagen AG, forced smartphone makers to stockpile at exorbitant prices and galvanized a global movement, including in the US, to attract and build local chip manufacturing.
> Back then it was because of an unexpected surge in demand for products from people working from home and trying to minimize contact.
> This time round, the shortages stem from the memory industry’s pivot toward AI. Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp., Amazon and Alphabet are throwing astronomical sums at data centers that can train and host artificial intelligence algorithms, hiking spending from $217 billion in 2024 to about $360 billion last year — to an estimated $650 billion in 2026.
> That splurge — rivaling the costliest human endeavors in history — is borne out of ambitions to outdo their giant rivals in a field that could determine their futures. The big four tech firms are paying top dollar for the components, resources and human talent that will make all that AI infrastructure possible.
> Few sectors have been transformed by that headlong rush more than global memory. In the three years since ChatGPT, Samsung, SK Hynix and Micron have diverted the bulk of their manufacturing, research and investments toward the HBM used in AI accelerators from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. That means less plant capacity to make plain-vanilla DRAM for basic electronics like phones.
> The three companies are prioritizing HBM over DRAM because of simple math.
> For every Nvidia AI accelerator that the hyperscalers buy, these companies also need high-bandwidth memory, or HBM, to power their efforts. Such chips are made up of intricately packed DRAM, often stacked in layers of eight or 12. Nvidia’s latest Blackwell comes with 192 gigabytes of RAM, or six times the amount that a powerful modern PC would need. An integrated AI server system dubbed the NVL72 boasts 72 Blackwell chips and 13.4 terabytes of RAM. Each NVL72 rack-scale system sold uses enough memory for a thousand high-end smartphones or a few hundred beefy PCs.
> The demand for HBMs will increase 70% year-over-year in 2026 alone, Taipei-based consultancy TrendForce estimates. Meanwhile, HBM will take up 23% of total DRAM wafer output in 2026, up from 19% last year, according to the consultancy.
> They also — during normal times — yield better margins simply because Samsung and all can charge more given the imbalance in supply and demand. Micron’s revenue is expected to more than double in the fiscal year ending in August. SK Hynix’s sales more than doubled in 2024 and are likely to double again this year.
> But that wave of HBM business spells trouble for memory consumers. It’s leaving the rest of the world bereft of the memory that people need to store cellphone photos, steer cars, download movies and run computer programs. GF Securities estimates that there is a 4% gap between the supplies and demands for DRAM and 3% for NAND, but those figures do not yet factor in low inventories in some industries so the actual imbalance is likely bigger.
> “DRAM shortages are set to persist across the electronics, telecom, and automotive industries throughout the year,” Counterpoint analyst MS Hwang said. “We are already seeing signs of panic buying within the auto sector, while smartphone manufacturers are pivoting toward more cost-effective chip alternatives to mitigate the impact.”

### 4. [Why Investors Are Quietly Rotating Out of Semiconductor Stocks](https://www.benzinga.com/Opinion/26/02/50665431/why-investors-are-quietly-rotating-out-of-semiconductor-stocks)
**Source**: Benzinga | **Date**: 2026-02-17T18:38:00+00:00

> A newsletter built for market enthusiasts by market enthusiasts. Top stories, top movers, and trade ideas delivered to your inbox every weekday before and after the market closes.
> Semiconductor stocks have been a cornerstone of market rallies in recent years, driven by strong demand for chips powering artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and consumer electronics. Yet recent trading patterns suggest a subtle but meaningful shift: investors are quietly reducing exposure to the sector. The rotation is not dramatic enough to make headlines yet, but it reflects a growing caution about valuation, demand cycles, and broader market conditions.
> High-flying names such as Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) have delivered extraordinary gains, but their stock prices are beginning to outpace the fundamentals that supported them. Even after strong earnings reports, multiples remain elevated compared with historical averages.
> Investors appear increasingly concerned about the sustainability of growth. Demand for AI chips, gaming GPUs, and data center processors is strong, but supply chains are stabilizing, and inventory levels are rising in certain segments. When growth expectations are priced in aggressively, any sign of slowing orders or margins can prompt rotation into less risky sectors.
> Quarterly reports from major chipmakers show continued revenue growth, but guidance for the next quarters is more tempered. For example, while Nvidia and AMD continue to see strong AI-driven demand, some analysts note that sales growth may moderate once the current wave of data center upgrades slows. Intel Corp. (NASDAQ:INTC), meanwhile, is facing execution challenges on new process nodes, which raises questions about near-term competitiveness.
> This combination of high valuations and cautious guidance is leading investors to rebalance portfolios, reducing concentration in semiconductors in favor of sectors with steadier cash flows or more predictable earnings.
> Broader economic conditions are also influencing investor behavior. Rising interest rates and the potential for tighter monetary policy increase the opportunity cost of holding high-multiple growth stocks. Tech-heavy sectors like semiconductors are particularly sensitive because their valuations depend heavily on future earnings growth.
> Additionally, signs of slowing global demand for consumer electronics and a softer PC market add another layer of caution. While AI and data center demand remain bright spots, the sector is not immune to cyclical swings in end markets. Investors are positioning for a scenario in which high expectations may collide with more moderate growth.
> The rotation out of semiconductor stocks is part of a broader market trend toward sectors offering predictable returns and defensive characteristics. Investors are increasingly drawn to energy, consumer staples, and healthcare, where earnings are less sensitive to economic swings and cash flows are more reliable.
> High dividend yields and share buybacks make these sectors attractive alternatives to high-multiple semiconductors. This does not imply the semiconductor rally is over, but rather that investors are seeking balance and risk management in portfolios after years of tech-led gains.
> Institutional investors appear to be trimming positions rather than exiting outright. This "quiet rotation" is typical when markets are recalibrating exposure without triggering large-scale sell-offs. For retail investors, it signals the importance of monitoring both fundamentals and technical trends before adding or reducing semiconductor exposure.
> At the same time, cyclical or high-cost players may face margin pressures and inventory challenges. Monitoring guidance, order trends, and supply chain dynamics will be essential for positioning portfolios appropriately. Investors should consider reducing exposure to names that rely heavily on short-term demand spikes or face rising competition in their core markets.
> The subtle move away from semiconductor stocks is not a panic. It reflects sophisticated investors managing risk and balancing portfolios after an extended period of strong gains. Valuation discipline, macro awareness, and sector rotation are guiding decisions more than fear.
> This rotation serves as a reminder that market leadership can shift even when headlines focus on growth sectors. Semiconductors remain critical to the global technology ecosystem, but investors are increasingly pricing in caution. Those who interpret these moves correctly may find opportunities in both reducing risk and identifying areas of selective strength within the sector.
> The quiet rotation highlights a key principle for investors: market leadership is cyclical, and even dominant sectors are not immune to rebalancing. As semiconductor stocks pause or consolidate, attention is shifting to companies and sectors offering more predictable cash flow, operational discipline, and downside protection.
> Understanding these dynamics allows investors to navigate the market with more clarity. By reading the signals embedded in subtle rotation trends, portfolios can be positioned to capture upside while mitigating exposure to high-multiple stocks that may be vulnerable to shifts in sentiment or economic conditions.

> Market data suggest the rotation is gradual rather than abrupt. ETFs tracking semiconductors, such as the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH), show modest outflows, and trading volumes in individual names have started to normalize after periods of heavy accumulation. Relative strength indicators suggest momentum is cooling, particularly in names that led the rally over the past twelve months.
> For investors looking to stay in the sector, selectivity is key. Companies with strong competitive moats, diversified product lines, and robust balance sheets remain attractive. Nvidia, AMD, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (NYSE:TSM) continue to benefit from structural trends in AI, cloud computing, and advanced manufacturing.

### 5. [S&P 500 closes little changed Tuesday as declines in software shares weigh on index: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/16/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)
**Source**: CNBC | **Date**: 2026-02-17T19:22:00+00:00

> The S&P 500 inched higher on Tuesday, but declines in software stocks kept the index's gains in check.
> The broad market benchmark advanced 0.1% and closed at 6,843.22, while the Nasdaq Composite ticked up 0.14% to close at 22,578.38. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 32.26 points, or 0.07%, and settled at 49,533.19.
> Investors rotated out of beaten-down software names, which added to the losses they've seen this year, and into financial stocks such as Citigroup and JPMorgan. Shares of Citi jumped 2.6%, while shares of JPMorgan were up more than 1%.
> ServiceNow, however, was more than 1% lower, with its drop in 2026 standing at about 31%. Autodesk and Palo Alto Networks were down more than 2%. The former has notched a roughly 24% decline this year, while the latter has fallen 11%. Salesforce and Oracle shares declined nearly 3% and almost 4%, and their year-to-date losses were at 30% and 21%, respectively. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) slid more than 2%, putting its loss for the year at 23%.
> The software sector has been getting hit on fears that artificial intelligence tools could replace industry-specific software providers.
> "We just need time to see what earnings are going to look like from some of these companies," Leah Bennett, chief investment strategist at Concurrent Investment Advisors, said in an interview with CNBC. "I think those that aren't able to compete and don't really have moats around their business, you're going to see a deterioration," she continued, adding that such a disruption will also lead the market to decipher winners in the space.
> AI disruption worries hit industries such as software, real estate, trucking and financial services last week, pushing the S&P 500 to its second consecutive losing week. Both the S&P 500 and blue-chip Dow lost more than 1% last week, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq lost more than 2%.
> The Dow and S&P 500 both logged their fourth losing weeks of the last five. The Nasdaq recorded its fifth straight negative week, its longest losing streak since 2022.
> "AI innovation and its disruption are calling into question terminal multiples in various corners of the market that is driving investors to focus on specific risks, rather than broader exposure changes," said Scott Chronert, Citi U.S. equity strategist. "For now, the narrative is disconnected from good medium-term fundamental trends. The onus is on companies to convince markets of longer-run business moats, likely a Q1 reporting season theme, absent a renewed focus on a macro soft landing."
> Those concerns appeared to overshadow the latest consumer price index reading released Friday. The headline CPI data came in softer than economists polled by Dow Jones predicted for January. That followed a better-than-expected jobs report earlier in the week.
> Investors will get more insight into the path of inflation this week, with the personal consumption expenditures price index report slated for Friday. Before then, they'll monitor Federal Reserve meeting minutes on Wednesday.
> The New York Stock Exchange was closed on Monday in observance of Presidents' Day.
> The S&P 500 has traded sideways since first topping 6,800 in October, with some parts of the market showing strength while others are showing severe weakness. Energy, materials, staples and industrials are rallying, while financials, discretionary and tech has slid.
> That level of extreme dispersion usually results in broad weakness, as the stronger parts of the market catch down to the weaker ones, according to BTIG. However, the new leaders have yet to correct, the firm observed. Krinsky said semiconductors is a key sector to watch to see which way the market will go.
> "For most participants this is not a new revelation, but does continue to highlight how much dispersion there is below the surface," Jonathan Krinsky wrote on Monday. "The million-dollar question is which way does the bifurcation resolve?"
> Investors are loading up on stocks at a high enough level to trigger a contrarian sell signal, according to the latest Bank of America Fund Manager Survey.
> Portfolios are holding their biggest overweight position on stocks since December 2024 and their most underweight on bonds since September 2022, BofA investment strategist Michael Hartnett said. One caveat: Wall Street professionals are rotating out of U.S. offerings and into emerging markets and EU, though shying away from Japan.
> The bullish move has triggered the BofA Bull & Bear Indicator, a measure of stock market sentiment that is now sending a "sell" signal with a reading of 8.2. On a global scale, Hartnett said bullishness was last this strong in June 2021. High levels of market optimism can mean stocks are overvalued and should be sold.
> Hartnett recommends investors reduce risk in the first quarter and implement a number of pair trades that include going long bonds and short gold, long the U.S. dollar and short emerging markets and long tech stocks and short banks.
> In other developments, Wall Street also has taken its most overweight commodities position since May 2022 and has edged up cash holdings to 3.4% of portfolios, just 0.2 percentage point off the record low. Investors are betting on a "run it hot" economy, with the most optimism on growth since February 2022, Hartnett said.
> Gemini Space Station fell about 14% after clearing out part of its c-suite.
> The crypto exchange let go of its chief operating officer, chief financial officer and chief legal officer, according to its disclosure filed Tuesday with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
> The elimination of the roles comes less than two weeks after Gemini said it would lay off 25% of its workforce.
> The company first went public last September.
> Investor Jenny Harrington believes that buying hard asset, low obsolescence dividend stocks could be a good hedge against growing artificial intelligence threats.
> "They're stocks that, assuming humanity survives AI, we're going to be using these products throughout in the next 10, 15, 20 years," the CEO of Gilman Hill Asset Management said on CNBC's "Halftime Report" on Tuesday afternoon. "Nothing too exciting, just slow and steady."
> To that end, Harrington listed stocks such as Amcor, Kimberly-Clark, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Dominion Energy as ones that fit the bill. She added that these dividend names all have "decent earnings growth ahead" and yields of between 4% and 6%.
> Economic data is pointing the way toward more interest rate cuts this year, according to Citigroup economists.
> Even with a stronger than expected employment report and core inflation still above target, "details point to a clear path for further rate cuts," Citi economist Andrew Hollenhorst said in a note. Hollenhorst said that same sentiment is likely to be reflected in minutes from the Federal Reserve's January meeting that will be released Wednesday.
> "Markets have appropriately recognized the residual seasonality in jobs data and cooling trend in inflation," he added. "That means policy rates are likely to fall further this year. It also means pricing of Fed rate cuts is free to increase further as part of the general risk-off in markets."
> Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee told CNBC on Tuesday that he expects additional rate cuts this year so long as the inflation data cooperates.
> General Mills shares headed for their worst day in nearly six years on Tuesday after the Lucky Charms and Progresso parent lowered its 2026 outlook.
> General Mills said organic net sales would slide between 1.5% and 2% after previously forecasting between a loss of 1% to a gain of 1%. The company said operating profit and adjusted earnings per share would plunge between 16% and 20% despite an earlier prediction of 10% to 15% down.
> Shares dropped more than 7% in afternoon trading. If that holds through Tuesday's closing bell, it would mark the stock's biggest one-day retreat since a slide of more than 11% in March 2020.
> On Tuesday, 37 stocks in the S&P 500 traded at new 52-week highs.
> Tickers that hit this milestone included:
> The nine stocks trading at new 52-week lows were:
> — Lisa Kailai Han, Christopher Hayes
> Amazon entered its 9th day of consecutive losses on Friday. If red by market close, the stock will tie for its longest losing streak ever. Amazon first saw 10 days of consecutive losses in 1997, nearly three decades ago. Its forward price-to-earnings ratio is also the lowest since 2008. So far, the stock has shed nearly $450 billion from its market valuation.
> The streak began after Amazon revealed it plans to spend $200 billion in capital expenditures this year. The company plans to invest in AI by scaling its data centers and servers.
> "Every single customer is seeing more and more demand for moving their workloads to the cloud, putting their data on AWS and then layering AI on top of that to get value for their business," AWS CEO Matt Garman said in an interview with CNBC.
> The news comes after investors have expressed concerns about hyperscalers like Amazon overspending on AI. "It's an indication of how bullish we are about the future and growth of AWS," Garman said of the investment.
> Amazon is down 12% year to date.
> Rothschild & Co. Redburn upgraded Dollar Tree to buy on Tuesday, pointing to its attractive valuation, earnings growth and potential upside from the acceleration of its multi-price roll-out.
> Since it sold Family Dollar last July, Dollar Tree has refocused on its core operations for the first time in a decade, analyst Sam Hudson said in a note to clients.
> "Following the Family Dollar divestment, we argue that Dollar Tree is a higher-quality, higher-return, more cash-generative opportunity than it has been for the past decade, warranting a higher valuation than recent history," he wrote.
> Hudson's price target of $165 implies nearly 31% upside from Friday's close.
> Federal Reserve Governor Michael Barr said Tuesday he sees risks to both employment and inflation and sees keeping interest as they are the best policy for now.
> On the labor market, Barr said he sees a "tentative balance" between both low hiring and low firing rates but says the picture is "delicate" and "especially vulnerable to negative shocks." On inflation, he noted that the Fed's preferred gauge is still stuck around 3% with a "significant" risk that it sticks there, Barr said in a speech to the New York Association for Business Economics.
> "Based on current conditions and the data in hand, it will likely be appropriate to hold rates steady for some time as we assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks," Barr said.
> As a governor, Barr is a permanent voting member of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee.
> Japanese equities just had one of their best 2-week relative returns compared to the rest of the world ever, according to Goldman Sachs. And the firm sees more strength ahead.
> Goldman moved its rating on the country's equities in a Monday note to overweight from neutral.
> It comes after the Nikkei 225's nearly 5% jump last week after incumbent Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's Liberal Democratic Party romped to victory in the country's national elections. Analyst Andrea Ferrario said in the note that the moves after the election are consistent with months-long developments in the market.
> "Markets started pricing higher growth in Japan in September, and growth pricing increased further at the start of 2026, catching up with EM and outpacing both Europe and US," Ferrario wrote. "Japan equities re-rated vs. the World and the long-end of the JGB yield curve flattened, driven by lower uncertainty and investors' increased confidence in the Government and the BOJ's ability to resolve the 'bad' fiscal tail."
> Goldman recommends owning defense companies, shipbuilding stocks and names with exposure to corporate governance reforms in Japan. The firm added that despite the expectation for room to expand, implied volatility in Japanese equities is elevated.
> Trivariate Research has adopted a more bearish stance on U.S. equities this year, citing an increased level of volatility in the market due to a higher number of companies potentially disrupted by artificial intelligence.
> This list includes industries that caught some investors off guard, wrote Trivariate Research co-founder Adam Parker, such as those that could be disrupted by AI tools automating financial work flows and the introduction of AI freight tools.
> "While several of these stocks bounced higher late last week, we remain concerned that these stocks are 'guilty until proven innocent,' meaning they are more likely to have multiple contraction than expansion for the foreseeable future. We think a useful exercise for investors is to imagine that they are the CEO of a company and focus on businesses that are making a high margin off of them," Parker wrote. "This likely means certain data companies, and other expensive service companies are vulnerable."
> Outside of AI, other industries could also see higher volatility introduced by the Trump administration, such as companies affected by metals tariff rollbacks and credit card fee caps. As such, Parker sees a greater likelihood of multiple contraction this year.
> "The bottom line is this: when there is uncertainty, we should pay a lower multiple for equities than when there is certainty. We reiterate the view laid out in our 2026 year-ahead outlook that the probability of multiple contraction for the U.S. equity market this year is greater than the probability of multiple expansion," he wrote. "That makes us more bearish than consensus."
> Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee told CNBC on Tuesday that further interest rate cuts are possible if inflation shows more progress lower.
> Taking a cautious view on last week's consumer price index report, which showed headline inflation down to 2.4%, Goolsbee said he remains wary that the easing in prices will continue and wants to see what the longer-term impact from tariffs will be.
> "If this proves to be transitory, and we can show that we're on the path back to 2% inflation, I still think there's several more rate cuts that can happen in 2026," he said. "But we've got to see it."
> Goolsbee does not vote this year on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee but will vote in 2027.
> The S&P 500 began Tuesday's session in negative territory.
> The broad-based index fell 0.2% shortly after the opening bell, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.7%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 140 points, or 0.3%.
> Check out the companies making headlines before the bell:
> The CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, was above the 20 level on Tuesday, hitting 22.50.
> The index — otherwise known as Wall Street's "fear gauge" — was trading around 17 at the beginning of last week's trading period.
> Silver and gold fell in early premarket trading on Tuesday as investors awaited delayed economic data, with little geopolitical news during the holiday-shortened week.
> Spot silver was last seen down 2% to trade at around $74.85 per ounce, while silver futures fell 4% to trade at $74.7 dollars per ounce.
> Hecla Mining, which owns one of the biggest silver mines in the world, Green Creek Mine in Alaska, was down 3% before the market opened. Meanwhile, Endeavour Silver shed 3.5%, First Majestic Silver was down nearly 4%, Coeur Mining lost nearly 3.4%, Teck Resources and Silvercorp Metals were roughly 3% lower, and Wheaton Precious Metals was down over 2%.

> JPMorgan sees shares of AeroVironment rising as demand for drones and space capabilities swell.
> The bank initiated the aerospace and defense stock with an overweight rating. Analyst Seth Seifman's $320 price target implies that shares of AeroVironment could rally 31% from here.
> "AeroVironment (also known as AV) looks well-positioned to deliver mid-teens growth thanks to its exposure to fast-growing areas within defense, both domestically and internationally, including drones, counter-drone systems, and space," Seifman wrote. "AVAV is also one of the more experienced defense companies that could benefit from DoD efforts to expand the industrial base and adopt a more commercial approach."

*(Found 5 articles)*

### 1. [Chevron vs ConocoPhillips: Which Is the Better Buy as Energy Sector Crushes the Market?](https://www.aol.com/finance/chevron-vs-conocophillips-better-buy-144547141.html)
**Source**: AOL | **Date**: 2026-02-17T13:45:00+00:00

> Chevron (CVX) beat Q4 earnings with 12% production growth from Hess acquisition. ConocoPhillips (COP) missed estimates as net income dropped 37.3% on lower prices.
> Chevron pursues Venezuela expansion and energy diversification. ConocoPhillips focuses on cost cuts and returned 45% of operating cash flow to shareholders.
> ConocoPhillips trades at a forward P/E of 17, versus Chevron’s 24, despite returning a higher percentage of cash flow to shareholders.
> A recent study identified one single habit that doubled Americans’ retirement savings and moved retirement from dream, to reality. Read more here.
> Chevron (NYSE: CVX) and ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) have both delivered strong returns as energy dominates 2026. The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE: XLE) is up 21.56% year-to-date through February 13, making energy the top-performing sector. Chevron has climbed 20.56% year-to-date, slightly ahead of ConocoPhillips' 19.04% gain. Both are crushing the S&P 500, but their recent earnings reveal two very different energy stories.
> Chevron reported Q4 2025 revenue of $46.87 billion, missing estimates, but adjusted EPS of $1.52 beat expectations. The company's record production jumped 12% year-over-year, driven by the Hess acquisition, which added 261 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day. CEO Mike Wirth called it a "significant achievement...integrated Hess, started-up major projects, delivered record production." Chevron's integrated model spans upstream production, refining, chemicals, and emerging energy ventures, including lithium and hydrogen projects. The company returned $12.1 billion in share buybacks for the year and raised its dividend 4% to $1.78 per share.
> ConocoPhillips operates as a pure-play exploration and production company. Its Q4 2025 revenue of $14.19 billion missed estimates, and adjusted EPS of $1.02 also fell short. Net income dropped 37.3% year-over-year as realized prices declined 19% to $42.46 per barrel of oil equivalent. While total production reached 2,320 thousand barrels per day, underlying production declined 2.6% excluding the Marathon acquisition. CEO Ryan Lance emphasized "driving $1 billion reduction in capital and costs in 2026" and highlighted the company's "best-in-class asset base...deepest and most capital-efficient Lower 48 inventory." ConocoPhillips returned $9 billion to shareholders, representing 45% of cash flow from operations.
> Chevron is expanding its global footprint and diversifying into new energy technologies. The company is reportedly in talks to expand its oil license in Venezuela, a potentially significant catalyst that could unlock additional production where Chevron already operates under U.S. sanctions waivers. This geographic and product diversification positions Chevron to capture multiple revenue streams beyond traditional oil and gas.
> ConocoPhillips is taking the opposite approach: optimize, consolidate, and return cash. The company doubled Marathon synergies to a $1 billion run-rate and is targeting $7 billion in incremental free cash flow by 2029. Its focus on Lower 48 shale inventory offers capital efficiency but less geographic diversification. Wolfe Research lowered its price target to $122 from $126.
> Both companies appeal to income investors. Chevron yields 3.88% with a forward P/E of 24. ConocoPhillips yields 3.02% with a forward P/E of 17, making it cheaper on an earnings basis. ConocoPhillips trades at a discount despite returning a higher percentage of cash flow to shareholders.
> Chevron offers diversified exposure through its integrated business model, Venezuela expansion opportunities, and new energy ventures, providing multiple revenue streams when oil prices fluctuate. ConocoPhillips focuses on capital efficiency and aggressive shareholder returns, returning 45% of cash flow to shareholders, though its narrower pure-play focus means less geographic diversification. Key catalysts to monitor include whether Chevron secures expanded Venezuelan access and whether ConocoPhillips can stabilize underlying production while delivering on its $1 billion cost-cutting targets.
> Most Americans drastically underestimate how much they need to retire and overestimate how prepared they are. But data shows that people with one habit have more than double the savings of those who don’t.
> And no, it’s got nothing to do with increasing your income, savings, clipping coupons, or even cutting back on your lifestyle. It’s much more straightforward (and powerful) than any of that. Frankly, it’s shocking more people don’t adopt the habit given how easy it is.

**Source**: Cantech Letter | **Date**: 2026-02-17T14:06:00+00:00

> Calgary, Alberta–(Newsfile Corp. – February 17, 2026) – Bengal Energy Ltd. (TSX: BNG) (“Bengal” or the “Company”) today announces its financial and operating results for the year end and third quarter of fiscal 2026 ended December, 2025.
> THIRD-QUARTER FISCAL 2026 HIGHLIGHTS:
> The following is an overview of the financial and operational results during the three and nine months ending December 31, 2025. All amounts are in Canadian funds unless otherwise noted:
> Sales revenue – Crude oil sales revenue was $1.0 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2026, 29% lower than $1.4 million in Q3 fiscal 2025. Production was 115 barrels of oil per day (“bopd”) in Q3 fiscal 2025, 7% lower than 124 bopd in Q3 fiscal 2025. Realized oil price was US$63.63 per barrel (“bbl”), 15% lower during Q3 fiscal 2026 compared to US$74.61/bbl Q3 fiscal 2025.
> Funds from operations1  – Funds (used in) operations was $0.1 million during Q3 fiscal 2026 compared to funds from operations of $23 thousand in Q3 fiscal 2025, driven by a $0.4 million decrease in revenue, offset by lower operating expense of $0.1 million and a $0.2 million reduction in general and administrative expenses.
> Net loss – Bengal reported a net loss of $0.4 million in Q3 fiscal 2026, consistent with Q3 fiscal 2025.
> Production volumes – The Company’s share of total Cuisinier production in the current quarter was 10,615 (115 bopd), a decrease of 7% compared to production of 11,420 bbls (124 bopd) in the third quarter of fiscal 2025. Production from four wells which were the subject of workovers were brought back on stream during the quarter, however production volumes from these wells have not yet resumed to pre-workover volumes.  The Company has requested information from the operator to explain production results and the allocation of production between the joint venture partners.
> Bengal has filed its consolidated financial statements and management’s discussion and analysis for the quarter end December 31, 2025, with the Canadian securities regulators. The documents are available on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca or by visiting Bengal’s website at www.bengalenergy.ca.
> (1)         Non-IFRS and Other Financial Measures.
> Business developmentFrom time to time, Bengal has been in discussions regarding potential farm-out opportunities surrounding its exploration and development portfolio, as well as other corporate initiatives including acquisitions and divestitures aimed at increasing shareholder value. With oil prices under pressure and junior equity markets virtually closed for oil and gas companies, Bengal has been unable to advance these initiatives to date.
> Non-IFRS and Other Financial Measures
> Within this Press Release, references are made to terms commonly used in the oil and gas industry. Operating netback, operating netback per barrel, funds from operations, funds from operations per share, adjusted net income, and adjusted net income per share do not have any standardized meaning under IFRS and are referred to as non-IFRS measures. Management believes the presentation of the non-IFRS measures above provides useful information to investors and shareholders as the measures provide increased transparency and the ability to better analyze performance against prior periods on a comparable basis.
> Bengal utilizes operating netback as a key performance indicator and is utilized by Bengal to better analyze the operating performance of its petroleum and natural gas assets against prior periods. Operating netback is calculated oil sales deducting royalties and operating expenses. The following table reconciles petroleum and natural gas revenue to netback:
> Funds from (used in) operations
> Management utilized funds from (used in) operations as a measure to assess the Company’s ability to generate cash not subject to short-term movements in non-cash operating working capital. Funds from (used in) operations is calculated by adding back all non-cash expense deductions to the net loss for the period ended. The following table reconciles cash from operating activities to funds from operations, which is used in this MD&A:
> Bengal uses working capital to monitor its capital structure, liquidity, and its ability to fund current operations. Working capital is calculated as current assets, less current liabilities but excludes other obligations and the current portion of decommissioning obligations.
> Bengal uses operating netback per boe to assess the Company’s operating performance on a per unit of production basis. Operating netback per barrel equals operating netback divided by the applicable number of barrels of production.
> Bengal uses funds from operations per share to assess the ability of the Company to generate the funds necessary for financing, operating, and capital activities on a per-share basis. This is a non-IFRS measure calculated by dividing funds from operations by weighted average basic and diluted shares outstanding for the periods disclosed.
> Bengal Energy Ltd. is an international junior oil and gas exploration and production company with assets in Australia. The Company is committed to growing shareholder value through international exploration, production, and acquisitions. Bengal’s common shares trade on the TSX under the symbol “BNG”. Additional information is available at www.bengalenergy.ca

> Within this news release, references are made to terms commonly used in the oil and gas industry. Funds from (used in) operations, funds from (used in) operations per share, operating netback, netback per bbl, adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per share do not have any standardized meaning under IFRS and previous GAAP and are referred to as non-IFRS measures. Funds from (used in) operations per share are calculated based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding consistent with the calculation of net income (loss) per share. Operating netback includes realized losses on financial instruments. Netback per bbl is calculated by dividing revenue (including realized loss on financial instruments) less royalties, and operating expenses by the total production of the Company measured in bbl. Adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per share are calculated based on Net income (loss) plus unrealized loss (gain) on financial instruments less unrealized foreign exchange loss (gain) and non-cash impairment of non-current assets. The Company’s calculation of the non-IFRS measures included herein may differ from the calculation of similar measures by other issuers. Therefore, the Company’s non-IFRS measures may not be comparable to other similar measures used by other issuers. Funds from operations is not intended to represent operating profit for the period nor should it be viewed as an alternative to operating profit, net income, cash flow from operations or other measures of financial performance calculated in accordance with IFRS. Non-IFRS measures should only be used with the Company’s annual audited and interim financial statements.

### 3. [LOGAN ENERGY CORP. ANNOUNCES A 31% INCREASE IN YEAR-END 2025 RESERVES](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/logan-energy-corp-announces-a-31-increase-in-year-end-2025-reserves-808805325.html)
**Source**: Newswire | **Date**: 2026-02-17T21:01:00+00:00

> CALGARY, AB, Feb. 17, 2026 /CNW/ - Logan Energy Corp. (TSXV: LGN) ("Logan" or the "Company") announces the results of the 2025 year end reserves evaluation.
> 2025 RESERVES EVALUATION HIGHLIGHTS
> Logan is pleased to provide below select highlights from the results of its oil and gas reserves evaluation as of December 31, 2025 (the "McDaniel Report"), as prepared by its independent qualified reserves evaluator, McDaniel & Associates Consultants Ltd. ("McDaniel"). The evaluation of Logan's properties was prepared in accordance with the definitions, standards and procedures contained in the most recent publication of the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluation Handbook ("COGEH") and National Instrument 51-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities ("NI 51-101"), and was based on the published average forecast pricing of three independent reserves evaluation firms (McDaniel, GLJ Ltd., Sproule Associates Limited). See "Reader Advisories – Reserves Disclosure" for more information. Additional reserves information as required under NI 51-101 will be included in Logan's AIF for the year ended December 31, 2025, which is expected to be filed on or before March 31, 2026 on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca.
> Proved Developed Producing ("PDP")
> Total Proved plus Probable ("TPP")
> NPV of Reserves, discounted at 10% before-tax ($MM)
> The following tables highlight the findings of the McDaniel Report. The numbers in the tables below may not add due to rounding.
> Summary of Reserves Volumes as at December 31, 2025
> The Company's reserves volumes and undiscounted future development capital ("FDC") costs as at December 31, 2025 are summarized below:
> (1) Gross working interest reserves before royalty deductions.
> (2) Natural gas liquids include condensate volumes.
> Net Present Value of Future Net Revenue as at December 31, 2025
> The following table summarizes the NPV of the Company's reserves (before-tax) as at December 31, 2025. The reserves value on a $/BOE basis, discounted at 10% per year, is also summarized for each category.
> (1)     Unit values are based on net reserves. Net reserves are the Company's working interest reserves after deduction of royalties, plus its royalty
> interests in reserves.
> The following table outlines estimated annual future development capital expenditures required to bring TP and TPP reserves on production per the McDaniel Report:
> Logan is a growth-oriented exploration, development and production company formed through the spin-out of the early stage Montney assets of Spartan Delta Corp. Logan has three high quality and opportunity rich Montney assets located in the Simonette and Pouce Coupe areas of northwest Alberta and the Flatrock area of northeastern British Columbia. Additionally, the Company has established a position within the greater Kaybob Duvernay oil play with assets in the North Simonette, Ante Creek and Two Creeks areas. The management team brings proven leadership and a track record of generating excess returns in various business cycles.
> Logan's corporate presentation has been updated as of February 2026 and can be accessed on the Company's website at www.loganenergycorp.com.
> The reserves information and data provided in this press release presents only a portion of the disclosure required under NI 51-101. Logan's Statement of Reserves Data and Other Oil and Gas Information on Form 51-101F1 dated February 17, 2026 effective as at December 31, 2025, which includes further disclosure of Logan's oil and gas reserves and other oil and gas information in accordance with NI 51-101 and COGEH forming the basis of this press release, will be included in the Company's AIF for the year ended December 31, 2025, which will be made available on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca on or before March 31, 2026.
> All reserves values, future net revenue and ancillary information contained in this press release are derived from the McDaniel Report unless otherwise noted. All reserve references in this press release are "Company gross reserves". Company gross reserves are the Company's total working interest reserves before the deduction of any royalties payable by the Company. Estimates of reserves and future net revenue for individual properties may not reflect the same level of confidence as estimates of reserves and future net revenue for all properties, due to the effect of aggregation. There is no assurance that the forecast price and cost assumptions applied by McDaniel in evaluating Logan's reserves will be attained and variances could be material.
> All evaluations and summaries of future net revenue are stated prior to the provision for interest, debt service charges or general and administrative expenses and after deduction of royalties, operating costs, estimated well abandonment and reclamation costs and estimated future capital expenditures. It should not be assumed that the estimates of future net revenues presented represent the fair market value of the reserves. The recovery and reserve estimates of Logan's oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves provided herein are estimates only and there is no guarantee that the estimated reserves will be recovered. Actual oil, natural gas and NGL reserves may be greater than or less than the estimates provided herein. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil, reserves and the future cash flows attributed to such reserves. The reserve and associated cash flow information set forth herein are estimates only.
> Proved reserves are those reserves that can be estimated with a high degree of certainty to be recoverable. It is likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the estimated proved reserves. Probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves. It is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the sum of the estimated proved plus probable reserves. Proved developed producing reserves are those reserves that are expected to be recovered from completion intervals open at the time of the estimate. These reserves may be currently producing or, if shut-in, they must have previously been on production, and the date of resumption of production must be known with reasonable certainty. Undeveloped reserves are those reserves expected to be recovered from known accumulations where a significant expenditure (e.g., when compared to the cost of drilling a well) is required to render them capable of production. They must fully meet the requirements of the reserves category (proved, probable, possible) to which they are assigned. Certain terms used in this press release but not defined are defined in NI 51-101, CSA Staff Notice 51-324 – Revised Glossary to NI 51-101 ("CSA Staff Notice 51-324") and/or the COGEH and, unless the context otherwise requires, shall have the same meanings herein as in NI 51-101, CSA Staff Notice 51-324 and the COGEH, as the case may be.
> This press release discloses drilling inventory in three categories: (a) proved locations; (b) probable locations; and (c) unbooked locations. Proved locations and probable locations are derived from the McDaniel Report and account for drilling locations that have associated proved and/or probable reserves, as applicable.
> The following table summarizes the Company's drilling inventory:
> The numbers in the table above may not add due to rounding
> Total unbooked and total locations undisclosed.
> Unbooked locations are internal estimates based on the Company's assumptions as to the number of wells that can be drilled per section based on industry practice and internal review. Unbooked locations do not have attributed reserves or resources. Unbooked locations have been identified by management as an estimation of Logan's multi-year drilling activities based on evaluation of applicable geologic, seismic, engineering, production and reserves information. There is no certainty that the Company will drill all unbooked drilling locations and if drilled there is no certainty that such locations will result in additional oil and gas reserves, resources or production. The drilling locations on which the Company actually drills wells will ultimately depend upon the availability of capital, regulatory approvals, seasonal restrictions, oil and natural gas prices, costs, actual drilling results, additional reservoir information that is obtained and other factors. While certain of the unbooked drilling locations have been de-risked by drilling existing wells in relative close proximity to such unbooked drilling locations, the majority of other unbooked drilling locations are farther away from existing wells where management has less information about the characteristics of the reservoir and therefore there is more uncertainty whether wells will be drilled in such locations and if drilled there is more uncertainty that such wells will result in additional oil and gas reserves, resources or production.
> Forecast Prices Used in Estimates
> The following table outlines forecasted future prices that McDaniel has used in their evaluation of the Company's reserves at December 31, 2025, which are based on a three-consultant average price forecast. The forecast cost and price assumptions assume increases in wellhead selling prices and consider inflation with respect to future operating and capital costs.
> FUTURE COMMODITY PRICE FORECAST
> This press release contains metrics commonly used in the oil and natural gas industry which have been prepared by management, such as "RLI", "production replacement" and "net asset value". These terms do not have a standardized meaning and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies, and therefore should not be used to make such comparisons. Management uses these oil and gas metrics for its own performance measurements and to provide shareholders with measures to compare the Company's operations over time. Readers are cautioned that the information provided by these metrics, or that can be derived from the metrics presented in this press release, should not be relied upon for investment or other purposes.
> The McDaniel Report forecasts production within the Total Proved plus Probable category of 31,789 BOE per day in 2029 which is comprised of 116,298 mcf/d of natural gas, 1,980 bbl/d of NGLs, 86 bbl/d of condensate and 10,340 bbl/d of oil.
> The Company calculates its reserve life index or RLI based on reserves volumes, by category, divided by 2025 annual production of 4,777.2 MBOE. Readers are cautioned that the RLI may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation, and may not reflect the actual duration of inventory or life of reserves.
> The production replacement ratio is calculated as net reserves additions, by category, being the change in reserves volumes adding back produced reserves, divided by 2025 annual production of 4,777.2 MBOE.
> The components of Logan's "Net Asset Value" calculation are set-forth in the table below. The reader is cautioned that these amounts may not be directly comparable to other companies, as the term Net Asset Value does not have a standardized meaning under IFRS Accounting Standards or NI 51-101. The NPV of reserves was determined by McDaniel in their year-end evaluation reports, based on a discount rate of 10% before-tax.
> ($ millions, except per share amounts)
> NPV of reserves, discounted at 10% before tax
> Proceeds from exercise of options & warrants (2)(3)
> Fully diluted common shares outstanding (MM) (2)(3)
> Net asset value ($ per common share)
> Net debt, a non-GAAP financial measure, at December 31, 2025 of $89 million is unaudited and may change upon
> finalization of the audited year-end financial statements. "Net Debt" includes bank debt, net of "Adjusted Working
> Capital", also a non-GAAP financial measure. Adjusted Working Capital includes cash and cash equivalents,
> accounts receivable, prepaids and deposits, and accounts payable and accrued liabilities.
> The calculation of dilutive proceeds and the fully diluted number of common shares outstanding only includes
> outstanding securities that are "in-the-money" based on the closing price of Logan common shares of $0.85 and
> $0.70 per share as at December 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.
> For purposes of the net asset value per share calculation, the Company does not apply the treasury stock-method
> prescribed by IFRS Accounting Standards. Rather, the fully diluted number of common shares outstanding is
> determined by adding the total number of outstanding "in-the-money" securities to the number of common shares
> outstanding at the calculation dates.
> All dollar figures included herein are presented in Canadian dollars, unless otherwise noted. This press release contains various references to the abbreviation "BOE" which means barrels of oil equivalent. Where amounts are expressed on a BOE basis, natural gas volumes have been converted to oil equivalence at six thousand cubic feet (mcf) per barrel (bbl). The term BOE may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A BOE conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet per barrel is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead and is significantly different than the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil and natural gas. This conversion factor is an industry accepted norm and is not based on either energy content or current prices. Such abbreviation may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation.
> References to "oil" or "crude oil" in this press release include light crude oil, medium crude oil, heavy oil and tight oil combined. NI 51-101 includes condensate within the product type of "natural gas liquids". References to "natural gas liquids" or "NGLs" include pentane, butane, propane and ethane. References to "gas" or "natural gas" relates to conventional natural gas.
> Common shares of Logan trade on the TSX Venture Exchange ("TSXV") under the symbol "LGN".
> As at December 31, 2025 and the date hereof, there are 595.7 million common shares outstanding. There are no preferred shares or special shares outstanding. Logan's convertible securities outstanding as of the date of this press release include: 64.3 million common share purchase warrants with an exercise price of $0.35 per share expiring July 12, 2028; and 42.7 million stock options with an exercise price of $0.78 per share and an average remaining term of 3.4 years.
> Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements
> Certain statements contained within this press release constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities legislation. All statements other than statements of historical fact may be forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are often, but not always, identified by the use of words such as "anticipate", "plan", "endeavor", "continue", "estimate", "evaluate", "expect", "forecast", "monitor", "may", "will", "can", "able", "potential", "target", "intend", "consider", "focus", "identify", "use", "utilize", "manage", "maintain", "remain", "result", "cultivate", "could", "should", "believe" and similar expressions (or grammatical variations or negatives thereof). Logan believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date hereof, but no assurance can be given that such expectations will prove to be correct and such forward-looking statements should not be unduly relied upon. Without limitation, this press release contains forward-looking statements pertaining to: the business plan, objectives and strategy of Logan; the Company's opportunity rich assets; the success of the Company's growth plan; and Logan's booked and unbooked drilling inventory. Statements relating to reserves, RLI, recovery, costs and valuation are also deemed to be forward looking statements, as they involve the implied assessment, based on certain estimates and assumptions, that the reserves described exist in the quantities predicted and that the reserves can be profitably produced in the future.
> The forward-looking statements and information are based on certain key expectations and assumptions made by Logan, including, but not limited to, expectations and assumptions concerning the business plan of Logan, the timing and success of future drilling, development and completion activities and infrastructure projects, the performance of existing wells, the performance of new wells, the availability and performance of facilities and pipelines, the geological characteristics of Logan's properties, the successful integration of the acquired assets into Logan's operations, the successful application of drilling, completion and seismic technology, the Company's ability to secure sufficient amounts of water, prevailing weather conditions, prevailing legislation affecting the oil and gas industry, prevailing commodity prices, price volatility, future commodity prices, price differentials and the actual prices received for the Company's products, anticipated fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates, impact of inflation on costs, royalty regimes and exchange rates, the application of regulatory and licensing requirements, the availability of capital, labour and services, the creditworthiness of industry partners, general economic conditions, and the ability to source and complete acquisitions.
> Although Logan believes that the expectations and assumptions on which such forward-looking statements and information are based are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements and information because Logan can give no assurance that they will prove to be correct. By its nature, such forward-looking information is subject to various risks and uncertainties, which could cause the actual results and expectations to differ materially from the anticipated results or expectations expressed. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, fluctuations and volatility in commodity prices (including pursuant to determinations by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other countries (collectively referred to as OPEC+) regarding production levels) and the risk of an extended period of low oil and natural gas prices; changes in industry regulations and legislation (including, but not limited to, tax laws, royalties, and environmental regulations); the imposition or expansion of tariffs imposed by domestic and foreign governments or the imposition of other restrictive trade measures, retaliatory or countermeasures implemented by such governments, including the introduction of regulatory barriers to trade and the potential material adverse effect on the Canadian, U.S. and global economies, and by extension the Canadian oil and natural gas industry and the demand and/or market price for the Company's products and/or otherwise adversely affects the Company; changes in the political landscape both domestically and abroad (including geopolitical developments in Venezuela), wars (including ongoing military actions in the Middle East and between Russia and Ukraine), hostilities, civil insurrections, foreign exchange or interest rates, increased operating and capital costs due to inflationary pressures (actual and anticipated), risks associated with the oil and gas industry in general, stock market and financial system volatility, impacts of pandemics, the retention of key management and employees, risks with respect to unplanned third-party pipeline outages and risks relating to inclement and severe weather events and natural disasters, such as fire, drought and flooding, including in respect of safety, asset integrity and shutting-in production. The foregoing list is not exhaustive. Please refer to the MD&A and AIF for discussion of additional risk factors relating to Logan, which can be accessed on its SEDAR+ profile at www.sedarplus.ca. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on this forward-looking information, which is given as of the date hereof, and to not use such forward-looking information for anything other than its intended purpose. Logan undertakes no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. Any financial outlook or future-oriented financial information contained in this press release (including that the McDaniel Report supports a growth plan to over 30,000 BOE per day (39% liquids) by 2029, excluding any contribution from Flatrock) has been approved by management as of the date hereof, is provided for the purpose of conveying the anticipated effects of the Company's planned activities and strategies, and may not be appropriate for other purposes.

> Nigeria’s economic story has long been defined by oil, a resource that shaped the country’s wealth, politics, and global identity for decades. Yet today, a new kind of asset is emerging — one built not from crude beneath the ground, but from talent, innovation, and digital connectivity. Across tech hubs in Lagos, Abuja, and beyond, startups are creating solutions, attracting global capital, and exporting services that showcase Nigeria’s ingenuity to the world. Unlike oil, technology is renewable, scalable, and capable of generating opportunities across sectors and geographies. This report explores whether tech can evolve from a promising sector into a central driver of national growth, examining economic structures, foreign exchange potential, job creation, infrastructure, policy alignment, risk factors, and the demographic advantage that positions Nigeria to lead in the digital age.
> Nigeria’s economic structure has long been anchored to crude oil, a finite commodity whose value is dictated by global price swings and international demand. Between January 2024 and March 2025, the country earned approximately ₦70.1 trillion from oil exports, highlighting how deeply crude still underpins government revenue. This extraction‑based model is vulnerable to geopolitical tensions, price fluctuations, and global shifts toward cleaner energy — all of which can negatively impact foreign exchange and fiscal stability.
> Technology, by contrast, operates on a fundamentally different economic logic. Rather than extracting finite resources, tech firms build scalable platforms driven by intellectual property, network effects, and innovation. In Nigeria, the tech sector’s contribution to GDP has been rising, reaching an estimated 9% in 2025, already eclipsing oil’s roughly 4.8% share of GDP.
> Consider, for example, the surge in venture capital activity: Nigerian fintech companies alone attracted around $2 billion in funding in 2024, representing about 35% of total tech investment in the country that year. Robust funding in digital finance, payments, and services signals investor confidence and the underlying scalability of tech business models.
> For Nigeria, companies like Flutterwave and Moniepoint illustrate this principle: a single digital solution can serve millions of users across multiple countries, generating recurring revenue and attracting global capital. Unlike oil, the core input for tech is talent — a renewable asset that expands with investment in education, research, and digital infrastructure. Yet the critical question remains whether digital exports and tech services can realistically replace crude exports as Nigeria’s primary foreign exchange engine. As of now, non‑oil exports (including services) account for less than 10% of total export income, showing how much ground tech and services must still cover to rival oil in FX contribution.
> While oil still accounts for a significant share of government revenue, tech offers resilience, diversification, and long‑term scalability. If nurtured strategically, Nigeria could shift from an economy defined by barrels in the ground to one powered by bytes in the cloud — unlocking sustainable growth that is less dependent on global commodity cycles.
> Nigeria’s foreign exchange stability has historically depended on crude oil exports, which supply the bulk of dollar inflows and support the naira. When oil production drops or global prices fall, FX reserves tighten, import costs rise, and macroeconomic pressure intensifies. This dependence creates structural vulnerability: a single commodity largely determines liquidity in an economy of over 200 million people.
> Technology, by contrast, offers multiple FX entry points — not through physical exports, but through services, capital inflows, and digital transactions that are less exposed to commodity cycles. The USA, for example, earns substantial foreign exchange from software, cloud services, and digital platforms, with companies like Microsoft, Adobe, and Amazon exporting intellectual property and cloud infrastructure globally. China’s tech exports, ranging from smartphones to e-commerce platforms and enterprise software, have similarly bolstered trade surpluses and diversified FX sources beyond raw materials, demonstrating that tech can become a reliable engine for global currency inflows when paired with strategic investment and industrial policy.
> In Nigeria, remote work and software service exports are beginning to mirror this model. Thousands of developers, designers, and product managers now earn in dollars while living locally, effectively generating FX through global labor markets. Venture capital inflows into startups and remittances from Nigerians abroad also bring foreign currency, sometimes rivaling oil earnings in certain years. Yet unlike oil, tech inflows scale with talent, innovation, and competitiveness rather than production volume. The deeper strategic question is whether Nigeria is building globally competitive tech products or primarily exporting labor. To emulate the USA and China, sustainable FX growth will require proprietary platforms, intellectual property, and export-ready software products that earn dollars at scale — shifting from brain export to capital export, from coding for others to building for the world. This transformation could ultimately determine whether technology rivals oil as a long-term FX engine.
> Oil has never been a large-scale job creator in Nigeria. The petroleum industry is highly capital intensive, requiring massive investment in infrastructure, equipment, and logistics, but relatively few workers to operate it. Institutions like the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited oversee a sector that generates significant revenue without proportionate employment impact. Most roles demand specialized technical expertise, and the broader value chain does not absorb labour at the scale of Nigeria’s expanding youth population. As a result, oil wealth has often translated into fiscal income rather than widespread job opportunities.
> Technology operates on a different employment model. It is skill-intensive rather than capital-heavy, and its barriers to entry are lower for individuals with the right training. Across hubs in Lagos and beyond, young Nigerians are building careers in software development, product design, digital marketing, data analysis, and content creation. The ecosystem is youth-driven and increasingly remote-friendly, allowing talent to work for global firms without leaving the country. Crucially, tech can accommodate diverse pathways — university graduates with computer science degrees, polytechnic graduates with applied technical skills, and self-taught developers who learned through online resources and bootcamps.
> The pressing question, however, is whether tech can scale quickly enough to meaningfully reduce unemployment. Nigeria produces hundreds of thousands of graduates annually, far outpacing the current capacity of the startup ecosystem and digital economy. While tech offers flexibility and exponential growth potential, it also demands continuous upskilling and infrastructure support. For technology to rival oil not just in revenue but in social impact, it must expand beyond elite urban clusters and integrate into mainstream education and industry. The promise is real — but without deliberate investment and policy alignment, tech alone may struggle to absorb the full weight of Nigeria’s employment challenge.
> Oil has historically managed to thrive in Nigeria despite weak national infrastructure because it operates within insulated, capital-heavy enclaves. Major operators build their own power systems, security networks, and logistics corridors, allowing production to continue even when public utilities falter. The model overseen by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited does not rely on stable public electricity for everyday citizens to function. In effect, oil wealth has coexisted with unreliable grids, poor transport systems, and limited broadband penetration because extraction sites can operate as self-contained ecosystems.
> Technology, however, cannot function in isolation from public infrastructure. Reliable electricity is foundational for data centers, startups, co-working hubs, and remote workers. Persistent power outages increase operating costs, forcing businesses to rely on generators and alternative energy sources. High data costs further constrain digital participation, limiting both consumer access and startup scalability. Meanwhile, FX volatility makes paying for cloud services, software subscriptions, and international platforms more expensive, as most are priced in dollars. Hardware dependency compounds the problem: laptops, servers, networking equipment, and other tools are largely imported, exposing tech entrepreneurs to currency shocks and supply chain disruptions.
> Without comprehensive infrastructure reform, technology cannot become Nigeria’s new oil. Unlike resource extraction, which can bypass systemic weaknesses, digital innovation requires a stable, interconnected ecosystem — affordable broadband, consistent power, predictable exchange rates, and supportive logistics. Tech’s scalability depends on reducing friction, not navigating around it. If infrastructure remains unreliable and costly, the sector’s growth will be uneven and concentrated among a small elite. For tech to rival oil in economic impact, Nigeria must treat infrastructure not as a background issue, but as the backbone of its digital future.
> Oil in Nigeria has long been a government-dominated sector, with state-owned entities like the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited controlling production, distribution, and revenue. This centralization of wealth and decision-making has allowed oil to shape politics, budgets, and elite networks, often consolidating power within a small circle of policymakers and industry leaders. The sector’s regulatory environment is tightly controlled, leaving little room for private experimentation, and creating a dependency loop where national prosperity is closely tied to state management of a finite resource.
> Technology, by contrast, is primarily driven by the private sector, with innovation emerging from startups, entrepreneurs, and freelance talent rather than government directives. While the Central Bank of Nigeria has imposed regulations — including crypto restrictions and compliance rules affecting fintech startups — the ecosystem remains largely decentralized. Companies like Flutterwave and other tech ventures operate on global platforms, attracting foreign investment, building intellectual property, and scaling independently. Regulation matters, but it tends to guide rather than dominate, allowing market-driven experimentation to flourish.
> This distinction has profound implications for wealth and power distribution. Oil wealth centralizes economic and political influence, reinforcing hierarchical control structures. Tech wealth, however, is more diffuse: it rewards creativity, skill, and global connectivity, giving individuals and small teams the ability to generate value that crosses borders and bypasses traditional gatekeepers. If Nigeria can nurture private-sector innovation while creating a predictable regulatory framework, technology could decentralize opportunity in ways oil never did — empowering a generation of creators, investors, and entrepreneurs rather than concentrating power in the hands of a few.
> Nigeria’s greatest tech asset is not its startups, but its people. Millions of young Nigerians are acquiring software engineering, product design, and digital skills at a rapid pace, often through a combination of formal education, coding bootcamps, and self-directed learning. This talent pool is in high global demand, with companies from Silicon Valley to London and Bangalore actively recruiting Nigerian engineers and designers. Initiatives like Andela have formalized this process, connecting skilled individuals with remote opportunities while showcasing the country’s human capital on the world stage.
> The phenomenon of “Japa via laptop” highlights both the potential and the dilemma of talent export. Highly skilled developers can earn competitive salaries for global clients without leaving Nigeria physically, generating foreign exchange in a decentralized way. Yet, as seen in other countries, retaining and deploying talent domestically is critical for long-term economic influence. In the USA, universities and tech ecosystems have intentionally cultivated human capital to feed domestic tech giants like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon, creating platforms that capture both revenue and intellectual property locally. China pursued a similar strategy by coupling technical education with industrial policy, producing talent that powers companies like Huawei, Tencent, and ByteDance — firms that dominate global markets while anchoring IP and economic value at home.
> For Nigeria, the challenge is clear: are we building domestic tech powerhouses, or primarily outsourcing our brilliance? If most talent is employed to scale foreign platforms, the country risks being a supplier of skilled labor rather than an owner of high-value digital products. Converting human capital into long-term national advantage requires policies, incentives, and infrastructure that encourage engineers and designers to create platforms, intellectual property, and companies that originate and scale from Nigeria. The question is not whether Nigerians are talented — it is whether that talent is being harnessed strategically, as in the USA and China, to produce local tech powerhouses instead of merely coding for global clients.
> The dominance of oil in Nigeria’s economy did not occur organically; it was the result of strong political will and deliberate policy alignment. The state prioritized oil through industrial policies, export incentives, and large-scale investment in infrastructure and exploration. This created a feedback loop where revenues reinforced government capacity to invest further, cementing oil’s centrality in the national economy. Without such deliberate intervention, oil might have remained just one of many sectors rather than the linchpin of Nigeria’s economic and political landscape.
> Technology requires a similarly intentional approach, but one tailored to the digital economy. Countries like the USA and China illustrate how sustained investment in research, university-industry partnerships, and coordinated innovation ecosystems can generate global tech leadership. For Nigeria, this means establishing a cohesive industrial strategy that treats tech as a national priority while embedding concrete operational steps:
> Ultimately, technology will not become “Nigeria’s oil” by accident. It requires deliberate, long-term state strategy, sustained funding, and active coordination between government and industry. Without such alignment, the sector risks fragmentation, underinvestment, and talent drain. History demonstrates that when a state commits strategically — as it did with oil, or as the USA and China have done with technology — it can shape markets, guide investment, and catalyze sustained economic transformation. By implementing these concrete steps, Nigeria can ensure that its digital economy grows in a coordinated, inclusive, and globally competitive way.
> While technology holds enormous promise, it is important to avoid overhyping its potential in Nigeria. Startup ecosystems are inherently risky: data from 2020–2025 shows that approximately 60% of Nigerian tech startups fail within the first three years, making survival a real challenge, especially during funding slowdowns or global VC contractions. A nuanced analysis must recognize that excitement around unicorns and high-profile exits does not automatically translate into a stable, diversified tech sector.
> Another concern is the over-concentration of investment in certain subsectors, especially fintech. Fintech alone captured over 70% of total VC funding in the same period, leaving other areas such as healthtech, agritech, and deep technology underfunded and underdeveloped. This narrow focus creates vulnerabilities, as the sector’s growth becomes tied to a few markets and products rather than broad-based innovation. Without deliberate policy and investment to diversify tech, the ecosystem risks mimicking the mono-sector dominance seen in oil, leaving the economy exposed to shocks.
> The lesson from Nigeria’s oil dependency is clear: relying too heavily on a single sector can have long-term economic and political consequences. Tech monoculture—where too much emphasis is placed on one segment of the industry—carries similar risks. A resilient tech ecosystem requires strategic diversification, sustainable investment, and realistic expectations about growth and profitability. Highlighting challenges alongside opportunities ensures that enthusiasm for tech is tempered by sober assessment, avoiding the pitfalls of hype-driven policymaking and investment.
> Nigeria’s demographic profile presents a unique opportunity for technology-led growth. With one of the youngest populations in the world, the country has a potentially vast digital workforce ready to drive innovation, entrepreneurship, and new business models. Young people are typically more adaptable to new technologies, comfortable with digital tools, and willing to engage in entrepreneurial ventures, making them a natural resource for building a robust tech ecosystem. However, harnessing this demographic dividend requires deliberate investment in education, skills development, and digital literacy programs that equip youth to contribute meaningfully to the tech sector.
> The critical question is whether demographic pressure can be transformed into digital productivity. Simply having a large young population does not automatically yield economic gains; it must be paired with employment opportunities, supportive infrastructure, and access to capital. The USA leveraged its post-war youth and university system to fuel the growth of Silicon Valley, coupling technical education with research funding, incubators, and venture capital to turn talent into globally dominant tech companies. Similarly, China’s government strategically invested in STEM education, skill-building programs, and industrial policy to mobilize young engineers and entrepreneurs, producing a generation that powers companies like Alibaba, Tencent, and Huawei. These examples show that youthful populations become economic engines only when matched with deliberate policies, structured opportunities, and innovation ecosystems.
> For Nigeria, the demographic dividend could be the foundation of a thriving tech sector that not only creates jobs but also enhances national influence in emerging industries. Achieving this potential will require strategic alignment between education, industry, and government policies, ensuring youth are not just present but productive in the digital economy. By learning from how the USA and China converted their youthful talent into sustained tech-driven competitiveness, Nigeria can transform its demographic advantage into a durable engine of growth, rather than a latent social and economic challenge.
> Technology is not yet Nigeria’s oil, but it has the potential to become an equally transformative force — if approached with strategy, discipline, and realism. Unlike oil, tech depends on human capital, innovation, and network effects rather than finite natural resources, meaning its value grows with sustained investment in talent, infrastructure, and policy support. Experiences from the USA and China demonstrate that deliberate alignment of talent, capital, and government strategy can turn technology into a national growth engine: Silicon Valley emerged through university-industry partnerships, venture capital networks, and structured innovation ecosystems, while China combined state-led industrial strategy with targeted education, R&D investment, and talent mobilization to create globally dominant tech firms.
> For Nigeria, the opportunity lies not just in growing startups, but in intentionally converting its human and demographic assets into scalable platforms, intellectual property, and high-value digital products. Its youthful population, expanding digital talent pool, and entrepreneurial energy represent a renewable resource that can underpin sustainable foreign exchange inflows, generate widespread employment, and diversify the economy beyond oil.
> Realizing this potential requires more than organic growth. It demands a cohesive industrial strategy that includes:
> Finally, while tech’s allure is strong, overhyping the sector or allowing monoculture — as seen in Nigeria’s historical overreliance on oil — could be dangerous. A resilient digital economy must be diversified across subsectors, backed by long-term state strategy, and guided by realistic expectations of scale, risk, and profitability.
> With deliberate coordination between government, private sector, and education, Nigeria can transform technology from a promising sector into a central driver of national competitiveness, economic resilience, and global influence – creating a new engine of growth that builds on the lessons of oil while avoiding its pitfalls.
