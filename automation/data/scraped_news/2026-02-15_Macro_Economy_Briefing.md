### 1. [What to Expect in Markets This Week: Walmart Earnings; Data on Inflation, Housing and Trade; Q4 GDP; and Presidents Day Holiday](https://www.investopedia.com/what-to-expect-in-markets-this-week-presidents-day-holiday-fresh-data-on-inflation-housing-and-trade-walmart-earnings-q4-gdp-11905280)

> A closely watched retail earnings report and some inflation data will highlight a holiday shortened trading wek.
> Markets are closed Monday for Presidents Day. Once trading resumes, investors will be getting data delayed by last year’s shutdown, including Friday’s release of the the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation report for December, updated housing starts and home sales data, and the U.S. trade deficit.
> Retail giant Walmart will be in the spotlight Thursday when it releases its quarterly earnings report. Traders are also expecting financial updates from John Deere, Analog Devices, Palo Alto Networks, Carvana, and DoorDash.
> Read to the bottom for our calendar of key events—and one more thing.
> Investors will get another look at December inflation with Friday’s release of the PCE report. Inflation measured by the Consumer Price Index remained unchanged in December, ad the PCE report is closely followed by the Federal Reserve, meaning its pricing data could influence how officials view the path of interest rates. The minutes for the January meeting of the Federal Reserve are also likely to provide insight into officials’ views on the state of the economy.
> Investors will get their first look at economic growth measurements for the fourth quarter with the Thursday release of GDP. It comes after the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported strong economic growth in the third quarter, with its final revisions coming in at 4.4%.
> New home sales and housing starts data for both November and December are scheduled for release this week, and pending home sales for January will provide a forward-looking indicator for the housing market. Two reports on U.S. international trade are also due this week, while durable-goods orders for December can offer insight into the health of the manufacturing sector.
> Walmart is set to issue its first earnings report under new CEO John Furner. The retailer recently hit $1 trillion in market capitalization, making it the first big box store to reach that size. In its last report, Walmart posted a 4.2% increase in comparable sales and raised its full-year sales forecast.
> Farm equipment maker John Deere's report follows a warning that its annual net income would come in lower than expectations as it faced difficult market conditions. Deere’s results can serve as a market indicator for the agricultural and industrial sectors. Tech firms on the reporting calendar include including chipmaker Analog Devices, cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks, and chip design software maker Cadence Design.
> Meanwhile, the quarterly 13F fillings that detail the holdings and transactions of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) and other big investors are expected to start showing up this week, illustrating fourth-quarter porfolio changes. Big moves by Berkshire would be considered some of the last under Warren Buffett.

### 2. [Gold (XAUUSD) Price Forecast: Will US CPI Trigger a Break Above $5,100?](https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/gold-xauusd-price-forecast-will-us-cpi-trigger-a-break-above-5100-1579381)
**Source**: FX Empire | **Date**: 2026-02-15T03:29:00+00:00

> Gold (XAUUSD) price is recovering toward $5,000 after losing over 3.5% on Thursday. This recovery shows that traders are positioning for US CPI data release. The inflation data has direct impact on expectations of Federal Reserve policy, which is still the most important factor in gold rallies.
> The core annual CPI is expected to soften to 2.5% from 2.6% while the core monthly CPI is expected to increase by 0.3%. A softer annual reading supports the story of easing inflation which makes the case for Federal Reserve rate cuts and increases the demand for gold. However, if the inflation reading is higher, then it indicates presence of ongoing price pressures, which may postpone the easing of policy.
> Therefore, gold traders pay close attention to whether the inflation momentum is cooling or stabilizing at higher levels because a period of high and persistent inflation restricts the flexibility of the Fed and can temporarily cap positive momentum in gold.
> Despite this, there is a greater degree of market based inflation expectations over a longer timeframe. The chart below shows that the 5-year forward inflation expectation rate is currently close to 2.13%. This is lower than 2.4%-2.5% range that was seen during previous inflation scares. This data indicates that although 0.3% monthly core CPI indicates short-term price stickiness, investors still believe inflation will ease toward the Federal Reserve’s longer-term target.
> If CPI data surprises to the upside in both annual and monthly readings, the market will lower the expectations for two rate cuts by the Fed this year. That shift would lead to stronger US Dollar recovery and higher real yields that would have a negative impact on the price of gold.
> The daily chart below shows the strong key resistance at $5,090, as discussed previously. The price has been consolidating below this level during the past 10 days and failed to break higher. After this failure, the price dropped to $4,870 support.
> However, as long as the price remains above the $4,650 support level, the next move in the gold market will likely be higher. The emergence of an ascending broadening wedge pattern indicates strong volatility. This strong volatility is likely to be resolved to the upside if the price breaks above $5,100.
> The short term direction for spot gold remains bullish as long as the price holds the $4,650 support level. This support level is defined by the ascending trend line, which shows a strong bullish trend. However, a break below $4,650 will take price to $4,500 and $4,260. Overall, the price is consolidating after a sharp drop from $5,600 to $4,500.
> The gold to silver ratio shows a strong breakdown in November 2025 at 78. After this breakdown, the price also broke 64 and hit 43.40. However, as spot silver (XAG) hits resistance at $120, the gold to silver ratio initiated a strong recovery back towards 64. The recovery was extended to the 72 level, but the weekly close was below 64.
> This marked a sharp shadow on the weekly candle last week, which indicates weakness in the ratio. A break below 64 will take the ratio to the 30 level. This drop in the ratio will indicate further upside in gold and silver prices.
> Gold price has been consolidating around $5,000 since markets await the US CPI data. This data will clarify the direction of Federal Reserve policy. Softer inflation would help to support expectations of rate cuts. But a firmer reading could delay policy easing and cause short-term volatility in financial markets.
> From technical point of view, the gold price remains structurally bullish as long as the price holds above $4,650. A decisive break above $5,100 could open the door for the next upward leg. In addition, the weakening gold to silver ratio is a sign of stronger precious metal momentum.

### 3. [Bitcoin (BTC) Surges Past $70K as Inflation Cools, ETFs Steady](https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/bitcoin-btc-surges-past-70k-as-inflation-cools-etfs-steady-1579605)
**Source**: FX Empire | **Date**: 2026-02-15T06:24:00+00:00

> Bitcoin (BTC) rebounds from $65,000, looking to snap a three-week losing streak. BTC reclaimed $70,000 for the first time in four trading sessions. Softer US inflation raised bets on a Fed rate cut, lifting sentiment.
> Speculation that the Market Structure Bill would pass the Senate added to the positive sentiment.
> While the US BTC-spot ETF market extended its outflow streak to four weeks, net inflows on February 13 signaled a potential shift in institutional demand.
> Notably, a dovish Fed rate path and the progress toward crypto-friendly legislation continue to support a cautiously bullish medium-term price outlook.
> Below, I consider the key drivers behind recent price trends, the short-term outlook, the medium-term trajectory, and the key technical levels traders should watch.
> The US annual inflation rate fell from 2.7% in December to 2.4% in January, below a consensus of 2.5%. Meanwhile, core inflation eased from 2.6% in December to 2.5% in January. Cooling inflationary pressures increased expectations of a June Fed rate cut, boosting demand for BTC and the broader crypto market.
> According to the CME FedWatch Tool, the chances of a June Fed rate cut increased from 64.6% on February 12 to 68.6% on February 13, following the release of the data.
> Crucially, lower borrowing rates would increase liquidity, potentially fueling leveraged positioning in BTC and speculative trades.
> Rising bets on a June Fed rate cut bolstered demand for US BTC-spot ETFs, which saw $15.1 million in net inflows on February 13. While inflows were modest, ending a two-day losing streak lifted sentiment. Despite snapping a two-day daily outflow streak, the broader weekly outflow trend extended to four weeks in the reporting week ending February 13, limiting BTC’s gains.
> According to Farside Investors, key flows for the reporting week ending February 13 included:
> Despite reclaiming $70,000, the four-week outflow streak has weighed heavily on BTC, which has tumbled 19.74% year-to-date. Importantly, the spot ETF flow trends support a bearish short-term outlook.
> Looking at the week ahead, US economic data will influence risk sentiment following the market response to the US CPI report.
> On Wednesday, February 18, the FOMC Minutes will give further insight into the Fed’s policy outlook. Fed Chair Powell downplayed the likelihood of a near-term rate cut, citing a resilient labor market and elevated inflation. However, a willingness to cut rates if inflation eases would boost risk appetite, given January’s inflation figures.
> However, Friday, February 20, is likely to be pivotal for BTC’s near-term price trends. The US Personal Income and Outlays report, Services PMI data, and Q4 GDP numbers will influence market sentiment toward the Fed rate path.
> A larger-than-expected core PCE price index reading for December and a pickup in service sector activity in January would temper bets on a June Fed rate cut, weighing on demand for BTC. However, a lower GDP print could overshadow the Personal Income and Outlays report, potentially giving the Services PMI a greater weighting.
> Beyond January’s headline Services PMI, traders should consider price trends. Softer input and output prices would align with January’s CPI report, supporting a more dovish Fed policy stance.
> US economic data in line with forecasts would reinforce the bearish short-term outlook. Nevertheless, optimism that the US Senate will eventually pass the Market Structure Bill affirms the bullish medium-term outlook for BTC.
> Despite reclaiming $70,000, the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index remains within the Extreme Fear zone. The Fear & Greed Index fell from 9 to 8 on Sunday, February 15. Despite rising from 7 on Sunday, February 8, the Index continued to reflect extreme bearish sentiment. Typically, these conditions signal a price recovery, reinforcing the bullish medium-term outlook.
> While fundamentals continue to support a constructive medium-term bias, downside risks include:
> These events would likely send BTC toward $60,000, exposing the August 2024 low of $49,351 (the yen carry trade unwind low).
> In summary, the short-term outlook remains bearish as fundamentals align with technicals. However, the medium- to longer-term outlook is cautiously constructive, subject to positive fundamentals developing. These fundamentals include the progress of the Market Structure Bill and expectations of Fed rate cuts.
> Despite recovering from $65,000, BTC trades well below its 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs), indicating a bearish bias. However, oversold conditions and evolving fundamentals suggest a rebound from the current levels, countering the negative technicals.
> A break above $75,000 would enable the bulls to target $80,000 and the 50-day EMA. A sustained move through the 50-day EMA would signal a near-term bullish trend reversal, bringing the 200-day EMA into play. A sustained move above the 200-day EMA would affirm a bullish trend reversal, paving the way toward the $100,000 psychological level.
> Reclaiming $70,000 brings the upper trendline into play. A sustained move through the upper trend line would invalidate the bearish structure, reinforcing the bullish medium-term (4-8 weeks) price target of $100,000.
> However, a sustained fall below the February 6 low of $60,000 would expose the August 24 low of $49,351 and validate the bearish structure.
> Track BTC market trends with our real-time data and insights here.
> US economic data, Fed commentary, the BoJ policy stance, crypto-related legislative developments, and US BTC-spot ETF flows will influence demand for BTC.
> Considering the recent price action, the medium- and long-term outlook remains constructive, with a 6-12 month price target of $123,731 (ATH). The US Senate’s passing the Market Structure Bill and rising bets on Fed rate cuts would support the bullish outlook.

### 4. [Gold and silver rate today LIVE: Silver, gold prices rebound as US Dollar weakens after better-than-expected US CPI data](https://www.livemint.com/market/commodities/gold-and-silver-rate-today-live-gold-silver-prices-remain-lower-more-pain-ahead-11770900951169.html)
**Source**: Mint | **Date**: 2026-02-15T00:06:00+00:00

> Gold and silver rate today LIVE: Gold and silver prices bounced back strongly on Friday after the softer-than-expected US CPI data. Defying the market expectations of 2.50%, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported the US CPI inflation of 2.40% in January 2026, putting the US Dollar (USD) under pressure. However, this is 0.30% higher than the December 2025 CPI inflation. This triggered buying in the precious metals. The COMEX gold rate finished at $5,046.30/oz, logging an intraday gain of around 2%. The MCX gold rate ended at  ₹1,56,200 per 10 gm, around  ₹24,500 below the record high of  ₹1,80,779 per 10 gm.
> Likewise, the COMEX silver price finished at $77.964/oz, logging an intraday gain of over 3%. The MCX silver rate ended at  ₹2,44,999 per kg, around  ₹1,75,000 below the record high of  ₹4,20,048 per kg.
> Currently, gold prices on the MCX hover in a tight range of around  ₹1,50,000 to  ₹1,58,000. And silver MCX futures are trading near the  ₹2,35,000 –  ₹2,70,000 zone.
> Recent corrections have wiped out a large portion of earlier gains, yet analysts see the pullbacks as opportunities within what many view as an extended multi‑year bull market for precious metals.
> Domestic brokerage Emkay Wealth recently opined that gold and silver are in a 3-5 year bull run, supported by favourable macroeconomic conditions, structural demand trends, and shifting investor preferences.
> Emkay Wealth recommended that the existing investors continue holding gold and silver as part of a diversified portfolio. Any incremental additions should be made gradually and preferably during periods of correction, it is advised.
> The US CPI data reported on Friday night signals a rise in US inflation, which is expected to put the US Dollar Index under pressure. So, gold and silver prices are expected to open higher on Monday.
> — Anuj Gupta, a SEBI-registered market expert
> The Bureau of Labour Statistics reported US CPI inflation for January 2026 at 2.40%, which is better than the expected 2.50%. However, it is 0.30% higher than the December 2025 US CPI inflation.
> Underlying US inflation accelerated slightly at the start of the year, in line with expectations, as a pickup in services costs more than offset stable goods prices.
> The core consumer price index, which excludes often-volatile food and energy costs, increased 0.3% from December, the most since August, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data out Friday. At the same time, the core CPI rose from a year ago by the least since 2021.
> The slight pickup in inflation reflected higher prices for airline fares, personal care, recreation, medical care and communication. However, prices of used cars and trucks, household furnishings and auto insurance decreased last month.
> Watch this space for LIVE updates in gold and silver prices.
> A sustained move above  ₹1,60,000 would likely re-ignite bullish momentum toward  ₹1,65,000– ₹1,70,000+, while meaningful downside risk remains limited unless COMEX gold breaches its structural support clusters decisively.
> — Ponmudi R, CEO at Enrich Money
> MCX Gold continues to exhibit structural resilience despite global consolidation, supported by relative firmness in USD/INR. The  ₹1,50,000 support band remains a strong demand absorption zone, attracting both physical buying and investment flows, reinforcing the integrity of the medium-term rising channel. Price behavior at lower levels indicates accumulation rather than distribution.
> — Ponmudi R, CEO at Enrich Money
> As long as gold sustains above $4,900 on a closing basis, the bias remains constructive, with recovery potential toward $5,150–$5,350 on renewed safe-haven demand or incremental USD softness. Downside risks would meaningfully increase only upon a decisive violation of the $4,600 structural base.
> — Ponmudi R, CEO at Enrich Money
> COMEX Gold continues to consolidate above the $5,000 zone, successfully defending the structural demand base formed after last week’s aggressive liquidation. The broader multi-year rising channel remains intact, with the $4,500–$4,600 breakout cluster acting as a key long-term support region. Current price compression suggests energy build-up rather than structural weakness.
> — Ponmudi R, CEO at Enrich  Money
> After the release of the US CPI data, US Dollar Index witnessed profit-booking, which triggered buying in the precious metals. The trend is expected to continue on Monday. We are expecting pressure for US Dollar when the FOREX market opens on Monday. Likewise gold and silver prices are expected to maintain sideways to positive bias.
> — Anuj Gupta, a SEBI-registered market experts
> The US CPI data reported on Friday night signals a rise in US inflation, which is expected to put the US Dollar Index under pressure. So, gold and silver prices are expected to open higher on Monday.
> — Anuj Gupta, a SEBI-registered market expert
> With central banks continuing to accumulate gold, interest rate cycles turning supportive, and silver benefiting from rising industrial demand, precious metals are increasingly being viewed as core portfolio assets rather than tactical hedges.
> Over 15 years, equities returned 12.1%, while over 10 years, returns stood at 14.2%. These figures reinforce why equities remain the core of long-term portfolios despite periodic volatility.
> Meanwhile, gold, even over 15 years, gold returned 14.4%, whereas over 10 years it delivered 19.7% CAGR. These numbers underline gold’s dual role as both a hedge and a long-term wealth creator, especially during periods of economic uncertainty.
> Indian equities, measured by the Nifty 50 TRI, delivered compounded annualised returns of 12.6% over 20 years, translating into a 10.7x return on invested capital.
> However, over 20 years, the yellow metal has delivered a compounded annual return of 15.6%, the highest among all asset classes, and multiplied investments by a remarkable 18.3 times.
> Long-term investing data once again highlighted a key finding - Gold returns have outperformed the Indian stock market index Nifty and other asset classes, including fixed income, real estate, in the long as well as short term.
> A comparison of returns across equities, gold, real estate and debt as of January 31, 2026 by FundsIndia’s Wealth Conversations Report shows that while equities have consistently delivered solid wealth creation, gold has emerged as the top-performing asset over the longest periods.
> Better-than-expected U.S. jobs data dampened expectations of more aggressive rate cuts, triggering a risk-off sentiment across global markets during the week. However, a softer-than-anticipated U.S. inflation print released on Friday has left investors divided over the future trajectory of monetary easing.
> — Ponmudi R, CEO at Enrich Money
> Gold has recovered post the Jan-end collapse and is well on its way to what we believe should be 6000 USD/Oz levels by the end of CY 2026. Though President Trump’s deal with India, a potential deal with Brazil, etc., has reduced uncertainty, higher inflation, as well as continuing geopolitical uncertainties, apart from the emerging split between the North West and the rest of the world, will continue to propel the Reserve Bank's buying. We believe all dips are an opportunity to buy Gold.
> — Sandip Raichura, CEO — Retail Broking at PL Capital
> On Friday, the Nifty 50 index finished at 25,471, whereas the MCX gold rate ended at  ₹15,220 per gm. Hence, the Nifty 50-Gold ratio comes around 1.63. As we know, if the Nifty-Gold ratio dips below 2.50, the chances of equity outperforming the precious metal increase. Hence, for those who believe in bottom-fishing in the current market scenario, the Nifty-gold ratio signals higher returns in equities.
> — Anuj Gupta, a SEBI-registered market expert
> The U.S. Labor Department on Wednesday (local time) reported strong jobs data for January 2026, with employers adding 130,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate declining to 4.3%, Bloomberg reported.
> The data released shows a strong start to 2026 as compared to the slowed growth witnessed in the previous year, when job gains averaged just 15,000 a month, down from the initially reported 49,000 pace. The Bureau of Labor Statistics report also suggests that the market is finding its footing after witnessing a year marked by rising unemployment and minimal hiring.
> The Bureau of Labour Statistics also incorporated new seasonal adjustment factors, with the previous five years’ data subject to revision. The agency also adjusts the relative importance of the individual price categories that make up the CPI.
> Alongside recent indications of a stabilizing labor market, Federal Reserve officials will likely want to see further inflation progress before lowering interest rates. Traders see roughly even odds the central bank will next lower borrowing costs at their June meeting after three straight cuts in late 2025.
> The Bureau of Labour Statistics reported US CPI inflation for January 2026 at 2.40%, which is better than the expected 2.50%.
> Underlying US inflation accelerated slightly at the start of the year, in line with expectations, as a pickup in services costs more than offset stable goods prices.
> The core consumer price index, which excludes often-volatile food and energy costs, increased 0.3% from December, the most since August, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data out Friday. At the same time the core CPI rose from a year ago by the least since 2021.
> The slight pickup in inflation reflected higher prices for airline fares, personal care, recreation, medical care and communication. However, prices of used cars and trucks, household furnishings and auto insurance decreased last month.
> Indian equities, measured by the Nifty 50 TRI, delivered compounded annualised returns of 12.6% over 20 years, translating into a 10.7x return on invested capital.
> However, over 20 years, the yellow metal has delivered a compounded annual return of 15.6%, the highest among all asset classes, and multiplied investments by a remarkable 18.3 times.
> A comparison of returns across equities, gold, real estate and debt as of January 31, 2026 by FundsIndia’s Wealth Conversations Report shows that while equities have consistently delivered solid wealth creation, gold has emerged as the top-performing asset over the longest periods.
> Silver faced additional pressure from weak U.S. existing home sales and concerns over softer Chinese industrial demand ahead of the Lunar New Year shutdown.
> — Kaynat Chainwala, AVP Commodity Research at Kotak Securities
> Today, silver has rebounded 5% to trade near $79/oz, and gold has also recovered to $4,990/oz as markets turn their focus to upcoming U.S. CPI data. Softer inflation readings could revive expectations of policy easing and provide much-needed stability to bullion prices, while persistent inflation and a resilient labour market could keep the Fed on a “higher-for-longer” trajectory, keeping prices under pressure. An extended rout in U.S. technology stocks remains an additional downside risk.
> — Kaynat Chainwala, AVP Commodity Research at Kotak Securities
> Extending the morning gains, the MCX gold rate today is above  ₹1,55,000 per 10 gm, logging an intraday gain of around 1.75%. Likewise, the MCX silver rate today is trading around  ₹2,45,000 per kg, delivering an intraday gain of over  ₹8,000 per kg.
> Extending the morning gains in the later phase of the Friday session, the COMEX gold rate today is trading around $5,040/oz,  recording an intraday gain of around 1.80%.
> Likewise, the COMEX silver rate today is trading above $78/oz, showing an intraday gain of over 3%.
> Gold traded positively in the early session, but the overall tone remains volatile to weak after yesterday’s sharp sell-off from  ₹1,58,000 to  ₹1,54,000, as prices failed to sustain above the  ₹1,60,000 mark. Resistance is now firmly placed near  ₹1,60,000, and if gold continues to trade below  ₹1,56,000, a retest of the  ₹1,51,000 support zone cannot be ruled out.
> — Jateen Trivedi, VP Research — Commodity & Currency at LKP Securities
> In the near term, trading may remain two‑way as markets digest US policy signals and risk events. However, dips are likely to attract buyers, supported by resilient safe‑haven demand and slowing real yields. Overall, while short‑term consolidation or pullbacks are possible, the long‑term trajectory remains upward, not indicative of a major correction.
> — Hareesh V, Head of Commodity Research at Geojit Investments
> Gold prices have turned choppy following their sharp swings in early 2026, but the broader structure still appears constructive. Recent volatility was driven by shifts in Fed expectations, dollar strength, and speculative flows, yet gold continues to hold above key psychological levels near $5,000, keeping the medium‑term bias intact. Most institutional forecasts also support a positive long‑term narrative for 2026, underpinned by strong central‑bank buying, geopolitical uncertainty, and a softer dollar outlook.
> — Hareesh V, Head of Commodity Research, Geojit Investments
> Easing geopolitical tensions, particularly around Russia-Ukraine and renewed U.S.-Iran nuclear discussions, dampened safe-haven demand. Silver faced additional pressure from weak U.S. existing home sales and concerns over softer Chinese industrial demand ahead of the Lunar New Year shutdown. Today, silver has rebounded 5% to trade near $79/oz, and Gold has also recovered to $4,990/oz as markets turn their focus to upcoming U.S. CPI data. Softer inflation readings could revive expectations of policy easing and provide much-needed stability to bullion prices, while persistent inflation and a resilient labour market could keep the Fed on a “higher-for-longer” trajectory, keeping prices under pressure. An extended rout in U.S. technology stocks remains an additional downside risk.
> — Kaynat Chainwala, AVP — Commodity Research at Kotak Securities
> Gold and silver retreated sharply on Thursday, with spot gold falling more than 3% to $4,920/oz and silver plunging 10% to $75/oz, driven by renewed weakness in U.S. technology stocks and shifting expectations around Federal Reserve policy following firmer U.S. labor data. U.S. jobless claims declined to 227,000 in the week ending February 7, down from 232,000 previously, while the four-week average held steady near 219,500. Together with the recent strong nonfarm payrolls report, the data reinforced expectations that the Fed will maintain a steady policy stance. Reduced bets on a July rate cut outweighed the impact of softer Treasury yields.

> Strong buying interest is visible in the $65–$70 support band, aligned with prior swing lows and long-term trend support. A sustained hold above this base, followed by a recovery and close above $85–$92, could revive upside momentum toward $95–$105 and potentially retest previous highs. The medium- to long-term outlook remains constructive, supported by steady industrial demand and structural supply constraints, despite elevated volatility.
> COMEX Silver is trading near the $73–$84 zone after a sharp correction from record highs above $121. While the broader bullish structure remains intact on higher timeframes, the steep pullback has pushed prices below key moving averages, indicating short-term bearish pressure and an extended corrective phase.

> Gold has recovered post the January 2026 end-collapse and is well on its way to what we believe should be $6000/Oz levels by the end of CY 2026. Though President Trump’s deal with India, a potential deal with Brazil, etc., has reduced uncertainty, higher inflation, as well as continuing geopolitical uncertainties, apart from the emerging split between the North West and the rest of the world, will continue to propel the Reserve Bank's buying. We believe all dips are an opportunity to buy Gold.

> COMEX Gold is trading near the $4,850–$5,100 zone after a sharp correction from recent highs above $5,500–$5,600. The broader uptrend remains intact, with the recent pullback reflecting profit booking and healthy price digestion. Prices are currently consolidating in the short term near current levels, trading above key moving averages, suggesting the correction is maturing.
> — Ponmudi R, CEO at Enrich Money
> The spike in retail inflation in January 2026 is mainly due to the rise in food prices, along with changes in components, with 2023-24 as the base. Technically, it is a good sign that, despite the changes, the inflationary trend has remained well within the RBI's comfort band.
> This will help sustain household purchasing power and confidence, supporting continued spending on essential and discretionary goods alike, keeping the pricing dynamics balanced. While this can be taken positively, it is critical to be watchful of how the situation unfolds as we move further into 2026, especially amid economic volatility driven by global headwinds.

> Strong buying interest is visible in the $4,500–$4,700 support band, and sustained stability above this zone could set the stage for renewed upside momentum. A breakout above $5,200–$5,300 would open the path toward a retest of record highs.

> US consumer prices increased less than expected in January amid cheaper gasoline and a moderation in rental inflation, but households faced higher costs for services, suggesting little urgency for the Federal Reserve to resume cutting interest rates before summer.
> The Consumer Price Index report from the labour Department on Friday showed underlying inflation pressures warmed ‌up last month, likely as businesses pushed through start-of-the-year price increases for goods and services, including personal care, recreation as well as airline fares and hospital services. The slowdown in overall inflation was cheered by the ​White House, with a spokesperson posting ⁠on social media that “America’s economy is set to turbocharge even further through long-overdue interest rate cuts from the Fed.”
> Americans anxious about the labour market and affordability have ‌soured on President Donald Trump’s handling of the economy. The report followed ‌on the heels of news this week of an acceleration in job growth in January and a drop in the unemployment rate to 4.3% from 4.4% in December.
> “Overall, the data suggest that price pressures remain a little too hot for comfort for the time being, but the direction of travel for inflation continues to look to be lower, even if this has proved a bumpy and slow process,” said James McCann, senior economist, investment strategy at Edward Jones. “For the Fed, this probably doesn’t ‌change much in the near term.”The Consumer Price Index rose 0.2% last month after an unrevised 0.3% gain in December, the labour Department’s Bureau of labour Statistics said.

Food prices rose 0.2% after accelerating 0.7% in the prior month. Grocery store prices climbed 0.2% as more expensive cereal and baked goods were partially offset by a 0.4% easing in the cost of beef and veal.Eggs and coffee were also relatively cheaper last month as were fresh fruits and vegetables.

Still, food prices increased 2.9% from a year ago.Consumers also got more relief at the pump, ​with gasoline prices dropping 3.2% in January from December. Though electricity prices dipped 0.1%, they surged 6.3% year-on-year, reflecting demand from data centers to power artificial intelligence. In the 12 months through January, the CPI ‌increased 2.4%. The slowdown in the year-on-year inflation rate from 2.7% in December mostly reflected last year’s higher readings dropping out of the calculation. The tamer inflation numbers were unlikely to resonate with consumers.“The primary explanation for the gap is that households focus on the price level while inflation measures the price change, but a secondary one is the behaviour of household essentials,” said Eric Winograd, chief economist at AllianceBernstein. “Food, medicine and rent prices are rising faster than the series as a ⁠whole, and those prices are more important to households than the overall basket.”Financial markets raised the odds of a June rate cut.

**Source**: Anadolu Agency | **Date**: 2026-02-15T13:23:00+00:00

> The three-day Munich Security Conference concluded on Sunday after intense high-level discussions centered on the war in Ukraine, Europe’s evolving security architecture, and the future of transatlantic relations in a rapidly shifting global order.
> The 2026 edition of the annual gathering brought together more than 1,000 leaders, diplomats, and security experts from over 115 countries, including around 60 heads of state and government.
> The conference opened on Friday with warnings about the erosion of the rules-based international order.
> US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the "old world is gone," arguing that rapid geopolitical shifts are forcing nations to reassess their positions in what he described as a new era. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz similarly warned that the international order "no longer exists in its original form," citing Russia's war in Ukraine and growing great-power rivalries.
> Ukraine, NATO, transatlantic unity
> Ukraine dominated the agenda throughout the conference. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said Russia is sustaining "staggering losses" in its war, urging allies not to fall for narratives portraying Moscow as a "mighty bear."
> He stressed that European countries are increasing defense spending and taking on greater responsibility within NATO.
> Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy repeatedly emphasized the importance of unity, calling it the "best interceptor" against Russia. He met NATO officials and US envoys on the sidelines to discuss air defense funding and diplomatic efforts aimed at ending the war, while maintaining that Kyiv will not compromise on its territorial integrity.
> European leaders highlighted the need for stronger defense coordination, with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen reaffirming plans to boost defense spending, saying a stronger Europe would reinforce NATO.
> Meanwhile, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer called for a stronger European pillar within the alliance while safeguarding transatlantic ties. He also said Europe must reduce certain strategic dependencies and work toward building a "more European NATO."
> Merz also stressed that the EU must forge partnerships with countries like Türkiye, India, and Brazil to address global challenges.
> Debates also touched on nuclear rearmament, with Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez warning that expanding arsenals would be a "historical error," calling instead for renewed arms control efforts.
> While US officials reassured European allies of Washington's commitment to NATO, several European leaders cautioned that unilateral approaches could risk weakening alliance unity.
> China and the US also held high-level contacts on the sidelines of the conference, with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi meeting with Rubio as both sides navigated tensions over Ukraine and broader global competition. Wang said Europe should be "at the table" in any future peace talks on Ukraine and signaled Beijing’s willingness to provide additional humanitarian assistance to Kyiv.
> Zelenskyy also met with envoys of US President Donald Trump ahead of anticipated trilateral talks in Geneva, saying he expects the meetings to be "truly productive," while reiterating that any settlement must safeguard Ukraine's sovereignty.
> Middle East, global challenges, Europe's future
> Beyond Ukraine, the Middle East featured prominently in discussions. Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan called for an immediate halt to killings in Gaza and urged progress toward Palestinian statehood, stressing that stability requires concrete steps toward a two-state solution.
> Palestinian Foreign Minister Varsen Aghabekian Shaheen called on European countries such as Germany and Finland to recognize the state of Palestine.
> Talks also addressed Syria's sovereignty and reconstruction efforts, as well as accountability mechanisms, following years of conflict.
> Iran's nuclear program resurfaced as a key issue, with International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi saying a new inspections agreement with Tehran is "technically possible" but politically difficult.
> Climate security and economic resilience were also debated, with leaders warning that climate inaction poses growing economic and security risks.
> On the final day of the conference, attention shifted to Europe's long-term strategic positioning. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas rejected claims that Europe is in decline, saying the continent must reinforce its defenses and global role in an increasingly competitive environment.
> From Türkiye, Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek, National Intelligence Organization chief Ibrahim Kalin, chair of parliament's National Defense Committee Hulusi Akar, and Presidential Chief Advisor on Foreign Policy and Security Akif Cagatay Kilic attended the conference and held bilateral meetings on the sidelines.

> Wednesday's FOMC meeting minutes at 2:00pm will offer the final detailed insights into Fed policy deliberations before leadership transition, while the earnings calendar features critical reports from Walmart (WMT) Thursday testing consumer health and Alibaba (BABA) Thursday providing Chinese consumer perspectives.
> The compressed four-day trading week packs substantial market-moving information into limited time, creating potential for amplified volatility.
> Here are 5 things to watch this week in the Market.
> AI Disruption Fears and Sector Contagion
> The rapid spread of AI disruption concerns from software companies to wealth management firms, commercial real estate operations, and logistics providers represents a significant shift in market psychology about artificial intelligence's economic impact. Wealth management selloffs reflect fears that AI advisors and robo-platforms could disintermediate traditional financial advisory relationships, while commercial real estate weakness suggests concerns about AI-driven property management automation and reduced office space needs as AI enables remote work efficiency. Logistics company pressure indicates worries about AI optimizing supply chains in ways that reduce human intervention and compress margins. This broadening disruption narrative creates sector rotation challenges as investors struggle to identify which industries possess sustainable competitive moats against AI encroachment versus those facing structural obsolescence. Tuesday's Palo Alto Networks (PANW) earnings will be watched for cybersecurity implications of AI proliferation, while Thursday's DoorDash (DASH) results will test food delivery economics amid AI-driven efficiency questions. The sector contagion could either represent rational reassessment of AI threats or excessive fear creating buying opportunities in oversold names.
> Friday's Economic Data Convergence
> Friday delivers an unprecedented convergence with Q4 GDP revision at 8:30am, December Core PCE Price Index at 8:30am, Manufacturing and Services PMI at 9:45am, and new home sales at 10:00am—essentially painting a complete economic picture in less than two hours. The GDP revision will provide final perspectives on fourth-quarter growth momentum, with particular focus on consumer spending contributions and business investment patterns that determined year-end economic health. The Core PCE reading represents the Fed's preferred inflation measure and will be crucial for assessing whether price pressures moderated through year-end or remained stubbornly elevated. The dual PMI releases will offer forward-looking perspectives on business activity entering 2026, while new home sales will provide housing market context. The compressed timing creates extraordinary complexity as markets must simultaneously digest growth, inflation, and forward-looking activity indicators to determine appropriate economic outlook and Fed policy expectations. Strong GDP with elevated inflation could pressure rate-sensitive sectors, while weak growth alongside moderating prices could support dovish positioning despite Fed leadership uncertainty.
> FOMC Minutes and Policy Transition Insights
> Wednesday's FOMC meeting minutes at 2:00pm represent the final detailed look into Federal Reserve policy deliberations before leadership transition, providing crucial insights into the internal debates that will shape the incoming chair's policy inheritance. The minutes will be analyzed for discussion about inflation persistence concerns, labor market assessment evolution, and the appropriate pace of future policy adjustments. Any revelation of disagreement among Fed officials about the necessity of recent rate cuts or concerns about financial stability could influence market expectations about the new chair's policy flexibility. The minutes may also shed light on how policymakers are weighing AI's potential productivity impacts against near-term inflation pressures—a debate that could become increasingly important as AI disruption fears spread across sectors. Wednesday's durable goods orders at 8:00am will provide additional economic context about business investment intentions, while Thursday's Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Index will offer regional industrial perspectives ahead of Friday's comprehensive economic data.
> Walmart and Consumer Spending Reality Check
> Thursday's Walmart (WMT) earnings represent one of the most important consumer health assessments of early 2026, providing comprehensive insights into household spending patterns, value-seeking behavior, and retailer inventory management. Walmart's same-store sales growth, e-commerce performance, and grocery inflation trends will help determine whether consumers maintained spending resilience through year-end or began pulling back in response to economic pressures. The company's commentary about first-quarter traffic patterns, basket sizes, and consumer trade-down behavior will be crucial for establishing expectations about 2026 spending trajectories. Tuesday's Medtronic (MDT) will provide healthcare equipment perspectives, while Thursday's Alibaba (BABA) earnings will offer contrasting Chinese consumer insights amid ongoing trade tensions and domestic stimulus measures. Wednesday's Carvana (CVNA) will test used vehicle demand, while Occidental Petroleum (OXY) will provide energy sector perspectives. Thursday's Newmont (NEM) results will offer gold mining insights following recent precious metals volatility.
> Commodity and Materials Sector Assessment
> Wednesday's Vale (VALE) earnings will provide crucial insights into iron ore demand, steel production trends, and industrial commodity pricing that serve as leading indicators for global infrastructure spending and manufacturing activity. Vale's commentary about Chinese demand, Brazilian operations, and commodity price expectations will help assess whether materials sectors can sustain recent strength or face headwinds from slowing economic growth. Thursday's Newmont (NEM) and Occidental (OXY) earnings will add precious metals and energy perspectives to the commodities picture. The materials earnings cluster comes as investors reassess inflation trajectories and real asset allocations amid Fed policy uncertainty. Strong commodity demand could validate inflation persistence concerns and support materials positioning, while weakness could suggest global growth deceleration that complicates economic outlook assumptions. The convergence of materials earnings with Friday's comprehensive economic data creates potential for significant sector rotation if commodity trends and economic indicators tell conflicting stories about global demand strength.

### 3. [From AI Summit to RBI & FOMC minutes: Key factors that will guide stock markets this week](https://www.fortuneindia.com/markets/from-ai-summit-to-rbi-fomc-minutes-key-factors-that-will-guide-stock-markets-this-week/130411)
**Source**: Fortune India | **Date**: 2026-02-15T11:22:00+00:00

> Indian equity markets witnessed sharp volatility last week, with benchmark indices slipping nearly 1% amid a sharp selloff in technology stocks triggered by rising concerns over artificial intelligence-led disruption. The late-week meltdown erased earlier gains and pushed equity benchmarks – Sensex and Nifty- close to their weekly lows, even as broader sentiment remained selectively constructive.
> The Nifty 50 settled at 25,471.10, down 1.30% for the week, while the Sensex closed at 82,626.76, losing 1.25%. The market saw a sharp spike in volatility, with India VIX surging nearly 11% as investors rushed to cut exposure in IT counters.
> The biggest drag came from the IT sector, which plunged over 8% during the week. Fears that rapid AI adoption could disrupt India’s traditional outsourcing business model dented earnings visibility and triggered aggressive profit booking.
> According to VK Vijayakumar of Geojit Investments, the heavy selloff on February 13, when FIIs offloaded ₹7,395 crore , skewed overall February flows into the negative. Data till February 13 shows FIIs have been net sellers to the tune of ₹1,374 crore this month, despite buying on seven of eleven trading sessions.
> Market participants believe foreign investors may have aggressively trimmed IT exposure as the sector reeled under what is being termed the “Anthropic shock,” referring to disruption concerns surrounding generative AI firms.
> After turning buyers earlier in February following the India-U.S. trade agreement, FIIs reversed course in the final session of the week. However, domestic institutional investors (DIIs) provided strong support, purchasing ₹5,554 crore worth of equities, cushioning the downside.
> Vijayakumar said that once the dust settles in IT, FIIs are likely to turn buyers again, especially given fair valuations in large caps and improving earnings prospects for FY27.
> Investors will closely track the minutes of the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) for cues on the future trajectory of U.S. interest rates, while back home, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will release the minutes of its latest monetary policy meeting, offering insights into the central bank’s assessment of inflation, liquidity conditions and growth outlook.
> The minutes of the January meeting of the Federal Reserve, due midweek, will be closely watched for clarity on the rate trajectory. U.S. GDP data for the October–December quarter will also be closely watched.
> On the domestic front, the RBI will release the minutes of its latest monetary policy meeting, offering insights into inflation assessment and liquidity conditions.
> Adding to the focus on technology and AI disruption will be the upcoming AI summit in India, expected to see participation from leading global AI figures including Sam Altman, Sundar Pichai, and Dario Amodei. The summit is also expected to be attended by heads of state and government from countries including France, Brazil, Spain, Sri Lanka, Finland, Greece and Switzerland.
> The event comes at a time when AI-driven repricing is reshaping global tech valuations and influencing capital flows.
> The coming week includes important domestic macro releases that could influence near-term sentiment, said Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Ltd.
> Markets will monitor WPI inflation and Balance of Trade data for signals on price trends and external sector dynamics. High-frequency indicators due include HSBC flash PMI readings for Manufacturing, Services, and Composite, along with bank loan growth and foreign exchange reserves data.
> These releases will be evaluated for confirmation of growth momentum amid volatile global cues and continued repricing in technology stocks, he added.
> With ongoing repricing in technology stocks and concerns around AI disruption, a selective and risk-managed approach remains advisable, said Mishra of Religare Broking.
> “Investors should focus on quality large-cap names with earnings visibility and strong domestic demand drivers, such as autos and consumption-linked sectors, while remaining cautious on IT until price stability and earnings clarity improves.”
> Trading positioning should remain balanced, with a tilt toward banking, auto, energy, and select metal stocks, while IT, FMCG, and realty may underperform in the near term.
> The near-term range for Nifty is seen between 25,200 and 25,700, with bias toward selective dip buying at strong support levels, contingent on global cues and FPI flow stability, he added.

### 1. [Governor points to significance of BERT 2026](https://nationnews.com/2026/02/15/governor-points-to-significance-of-bert-2026/)
**Source**: Nation News | **Date**: 2026-02-15T20:24:00+00:00

> With the Mia Amor Mottley administration returned to office for a third term, the plan to transform Barbados’ economy must now take centre stage, especially boosting the country’s productivity and competitiveness, including by completing key reforms and accelerating private sector investment.
> Central Bank Governor Dr The Most Honourable Kevin Greenidge yesterday underscored the importance of these initiatives and the overall implementation of the Barbados Economic Recovery and Transformation 2026 (BERT 2026) plan.
> International credit rating agency Fitch said separately on Friday that last Wednesday’s General Election victory positioned Government “to continue its reform programme with . . . BERT” and that the administration was well placed to make further progress in key areas.
> BERT 2026 was laid in Parliament before Barbadians went to the polls and Greenidge saw its successful implementation as central to future economic prospects.
> “BERT 2026 represents the third phase of Barbados’ reform journey. The first phase stabilised the economy. The second restored growth. This phase is about transformation,” he said.
> “The importance of BERT 2026 is that it moves us beyond fixing what was broken and toward building what is sustainable. Stabilisation gave us fiscal discipline, restored reserves and rebuilt credibility. Growth returned activity but transformation is about changing the structure of the economy so that growth is stronger, more resilient and more inclusive.”
> Greenidge noted that increasing productivity was the main focus.
> “Barbados cannot rely on volume growth alone. We must produce more value per worker, per dollar of investment, and per unit of infrastructure,” he said.
> “That means modernising public services, reducing friction in permits and approvals, improving digital infrastructure, strengthening logistics and building higher-value export sectors. Productivity is the foundation of higher wages, stronger public finances and long-term prosperity.”
> Greenidge said competitiveness was the second pillar and that “we must make Barbados easier to do business in, easier to invest in and easier to live and work in”.
> “That includes completing reforms in customs, business registration, financial markets and capital access. It also means strengthening institutions like Invest Barbados and ensuring that private capital, domestic and foreign, can move into productive sectors efficiently,” he explained.
> “Resilience is equally critical. Barbados remains vulnerable to climate shocks and global volatility. BERT 2026 embeds climate resilience, renewable energy expansion, water and food security, and disaster risk management into the core economic framework. Resilience is not a separate environmental agenda; it is economic risk management.”
> A number of reforms were earmarked in the BERT plans of 2018 and 2022, and Greenidge said that “completion of key reforms is essential”.
> “Some of the most complex stateowned enterprises still require restructuring to improve efficiency and reduce fiscal risk. That work must be completed. Stronger governance, clearer performance targets, and reduced transfers from the central government will free up fiscal space for investment in people and infrastructure,” he said.”
> Barbados’ future economic performance is also dependent on expanded private sector investment, Greenidge stressed.
> “Public investment alone cannot deliver transformation. We need deeper capital markets, stronger SME governance, operationalisation of the Innovation Growth Market, effective public-private partnership frameworks, and a pipeline of investable projects.
> “The role of the state is to remove barriers, provide credible policy direction and crowd in private capital.”
> His view was that BERT 2026 must ultimately “become a platform for broad-based growth”.
> “That means growth that raises productivity, strengthens fiscal fundamentals, deepens domestic value creation and expands opportunities for young Barbadians. Transformation is not about a single sector or project. It is about aligning fiscal policy, structural reform, private investment, and human capital so that growth benefits the entire society,” Greenidge said.
> “If we maintain discipline, complete the outstanding reforms, and focus relentlessly on execution, BERT 2026 can position Barbados not just to grow, but to grow stronger and more resilient in a more uncertain global environment.”
> Fitch, meanwhile, said the election outcome “facilitates the latest iteration of the Government’s reform programme”.
> “BERT 2026 follows two successful programmes that focused first on stabilisation of government finances and the economy, and then on economic growth. The country also completed an International Monetary Fund programme last year,” the credit rating agency stated.
> “The third BERT programme shifts the reform focus toward longterm transformation of the economy, aiming to ameliorate challenges relating to labour productivity growth, investment gaps, climate and external risks, and contingent liabilities from state-owned enterprises.”
> Fitch called BERT 2026 “an ambitious attempt to tackle structural constraints on potential growth”.
> It’s view, however, was that “the record of successful reforms backed by strong political commitment, a supportive Social Partnership and the Government’s newly refreshed mandate position it to make further progress in key areas”.
> It recalled that “previous BLP governments had already moved public finances onto a more sustainable path, with debt to GDP falling to 94.6 per cent in 2025 from a peak of 178.9 per cent in 2018”.
> Fitch added: “The debt ratio is still high, the 2025 ‘B’ category median was 53.4 per cent, but the positive outlook on Barbados’s ‘B+’ rating reflects Fitch’s expectation that it will decline further, as continued fiscal discipline causes deficits to swing to surpluses from the fiscal year ending March 2027.
> “International reserves increased to US$1.5 billion in 2025 from a low of US$200 million in January 2018, providing additional buffers against external shocks. Fiscal stabilisation has led to renewed investor confidence in government paper, as indicated by Barbados’s reentry into global capital markets in June 2025 with a US$500 million bond issue.”
> Fitch said the institutionalisation of reforms, ensuring they persist beyond the current administration, “is key for the long-term stability of the government’s finances and continued debt reduction”.
> “A possible third IMF programme could serve as an emergency fiscal backstop, although not this is not currently in development,” it noted. (SC)
