> US stocks retreated on Thursday as US-Iran fears spurred a continued rally in oil, with Walmart (WMT) earnings and Federal Reserve rate-cut odds in focus.
> The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell roughly 0.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) shed roughly 0.5%, snapping a three-session win streak for those indexes. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dipped 0.3%.
> The pullback came as oil extended its biggest daily jump since October amid growing worries of a US military attack on Iran, a major oil producer. Contracts for both Brent (BZ=F) crude and West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) rose more than 2% after President Trump said he would decide on whether to strike Iran within the next 10 days.
> Meanwhile, Treasurys were set for their longest run of losses in a month amid oil-driven inflation concerns. Price pressures were already in focus as investors parsed minutes from the Fed's January policy meeting, which revealed deep divides over the future path of rates. The December PCE inflation reading on Friday could help adjust expectations.

> Oil prices rose 2% to retest their highest levels since last summer, as traders monitor developments between Washington and Tehran amid nuclear talks. President Trump said he will decide on whether to strike Iran within the next 10 days.
> Airline stocks tumbled amid the threat of higher fuel costs with Delta (DAL), United (UAL) and American (AAL) all down more than 5%.
> Healthcare was this bull market's red-headed stepchild until the fourth quarter of 2025. But the sector perked up late last year, and ETF flows began to reverse years of selling.
> This year, XLV (XLV) has been printing higher lows into a flat ceiling, lining up with the August 2024 high — a classic breakout setup from a clear cup and handle chart formation.

> Deere (DE) is up over 13% today — its biggest one-day jump since the March 2020 pandemic rebound — blasting to an intraday record and pulling the agriculture complex greener with it.
> That pandemic rally would see DE up 12 straight months for a 270% gain, which puts its current five-month streak of over 50% in context. And with 6.5 trading days left in February, the farm equipment manufacturer is already up 27%, having its best month since October 1974 (up 45% that month).
> A huge beat and a raise for the first quarter is driving the surge. Deere lifted full-year profit guidance, feeding the “profit trough is near” narrative. CEO John May said the company was "encouraged by the ongoing recovery in demand within both the construction and small agriculture segments," and reiterated that 2026 looks like the bottom of the cycle.
> Needless to say, traders are front-running the cyclical recovery with gusto.
> One caveat: DE is looking parabolic and needs to hold the recent lows around $590 to $600 to avoid "aping" January's silver trade.
> Mortgage rates fell to their lowest level since September 2022 in the week ended Feb. 13, according to data released Thursday by Freddie Mac.
> Thirty-year loans averaged 6.01% last week, down from the previous week's reading of 6.09% and a pullback from an average of 6.85% a year ago.
> The news comes as affordability continues to dominate US consumers' attention, and inflation has remained sticky above the Fed's 2% target. As of Thursday, traders were pricing in a 94% chance that the Fed leaves rates unchanged at its upcoming March meeting.
> The drop in mortgage rates also follows data earlier in the week showing mortgage applications grew by 2.8% in the week ended Feb. 13, compared with the previous week's decline of 0.3%.
> Data on November housing starts showed a 3.9% month-on-month increase, below economists' estimates of 4.9% but above the previous month's 4.6% decline.
> The president of the Minneapolis Fed, Neel Kashkari, said he believes the Federal Reserve is "pretty close" to neutral at the current 3.5% to 3.75% target range — leaving little wiggle room to further rate cuts. Traders were pricing in a 94% chance that Fed leaves rates unchanged at its upcoming March meeting.

> The oil market has been closely watching developments in Iran, with recent fuel added by the Trump administration's decision to send a second aircraft carrier to the region.

> Continuing claims, which track the number of people continuing to receive benefits, rose by 17,000 over the previous week to 1.87 million, according to Labor Department data.
> The initial claims data comes as investor attention turns toward rate cut decisions at the Federal Reserve's upcoming meeting in March. The minutes of the central bank’s Jan. 27-28 policy meeting, released Wednesday, made clear the Fed is shifting further away from agreeing on another cut. The minutes even made mention of discussion around potential rate hikes.

> Epam (EPAM) stock sank 17% before the bell today after forecasting first quarter results in line with analysts expectations.

> Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma reports:
> Samsung Electronics Co. (005930.KS, SSNLF) shares jumped to a fresh record high Thursday, after local media reported that the firm is negotiating a price for its latest artificial intelligence memory chip that’s up to 30% higher than the previous generation.
> The chipmaker’s stock rose as much as 5.4% on Korea Exchange, as the market reopened following a three-day holiday. Samsung is looking to price its HBM4 at around $700 per unit, according to Chosun Ilbo newspaper. Samsung declined to comment on the media report.
> ... After initially falling behind smaller SK Hynix (000660.KS) in the early days of the AI race, Samsung has been mounting a comeback. Just last week Samsung said it started mass production of HBM4 chips and had shipped commercial products to customers.
> SK Hynix had set the price of HBM4 for Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) in the mid-$500 range in August but may move to match Samsung’s higher number, Chosun Ilbo said, citing unidentified people in the industry.
> DoorDash (DASH) reported fourth quarter results that slightly missed Wall Street's expectations on the top and bottom lines, while total orders rose more than forecast.
> Earnings per share came in at $0.48, compared with the $0.55 the Street had forecast. But adjusted EBITDA reached $780 million in the quarter — up 38% compared to a year ago and almost $5 million above the Street's estimates.
> Meanwhile, revenue grew 28% year over year to $3.96 billion, a tick lower than the nearly $4 billion Wall Street predicted. Total orders, which means all orders through its marketplaces and commerce platform, also jumped 32% to 903 million in the quarter. That's more than the 888 million analysts had anticipated.
> Its stock rose as much as 13% during premarket hours on Thursday.
> Marketplace GOV — the total dollar value of transactions completed through the marketplace, including taxes, tips, and fees related to DashPass and its international platform Wolt+, clocked in at $29.7 billion compared to the expected $29.1 billion.
> That was driven higher by growth in new customers and order rates among existing customers in the US restaurant category.
> For the first quarter of 2026, the company expects marketplace GOV to be in the range of $31.0 billion to $31.8 billion, above the Street's forecast of $30.75 billion.
> Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $675 million to $775 million, which is below what the Street predicted of $800 million.
> Oil steadied after its biggest daily gain since October, following an Axios report that American military intervention in Iran could come sooner than expected.

### 2. [As oil prices spike on US-Iran tensions, Goldman says investors are bracing for more volatility](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/oil-prices-iran-goldman-sachs-trump-economy-energy-crude-futures-2026-2)
**Source**: Markets Insider | **Date**: 2026-02-19T16:13:00+00:00

> Oil is spiking on the latest bout of tensions between the US and Iran, and Goldman Sachs's top commodities researcher says more volatility may be coming.
> Daan Struyven, the bank's co-head of global commodities research, told CNBC that he thinks the market sees tensions escalating further between the US and Iran, a likely catalyst for price hikes and longer-term volatility. Both US and international oil prices were up about 2% on Thursday.
> "Both prediction markets and oil markets are pricing some near-term moderate escalation as the base case," he said.
> One area in focus is the Strait of Hormuz, a waterway in the Middle East that handles 20% of both the global oil and liquified natural gas supplies.
> Struyven highlighted the passage's importance for international oil flows, adding that Goldman's base case assumes shipping through the strait will continue and that his team is not anticipating any long-term disruptions.
> However, Iran is one of the world's leading oil suppliers, and its government has made it clear that it intends to retaliate if President Donald Trump moves forward with his threats against it. This could mean attempting to block or restrict access to the Strait of Hormuz, throttling supply.
> If this were to curtail flows by 1 million barrels per day for an entire year, Struyven predicted that would justify an $8 per barrel price increase, a roughly 11% jump from Thursday's price for Brent crude around $71.50. However, he also noted that fear among traders could push prices even higher, adding to the volatility in the market.
> "Markets are continuously reassessing, not only the base case, but especially the probability of this tail risk of large oil disruptions in the Middle East," he said.
> Oil prices have risen this year after tumbling throughout 2025. The volatility in energy markets follows bouts of volatility related to the US attack on Venezuela in January and continued saber-rattling on Iran.

### 3. [Oil prices surge ahead of possible US attack on Iran](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-prices-surge-ahead-possible-200845647.html)
**Source**: Yahoo Finance | **Date**: 2026-02-19T22:05:00+00:00

> Oil prices are climbing over fears of a possible U.S. attack on Iran.
> The global Brent oil benchmark has spiked more than 7% over the past two days, vaulting the price of oil to about $71 per barrel, the highest level since July. Despite the recent surge, oil prices remain below where they stood a year ago.
> The United States and Iran continue to carry out negotiations over Tehran's nuclear program. Alongside those talks, the U.S. has amassed a major military buildup in the Middle East, including aircraft carriers and fighter jets.
> 2nd US carrier group heads toward Middle East amid Iran tensions
> Speaking at the initial meeting of the U.S.-led Board of Peace on Thursday, President Donald Trump appeared to keep his options open with regard to a potential attack on Iran.
> The U.S., Trump said, "may have to take it a step further" on the matter of striking Iran, but he then added, "we may not."
> “You're going to be finding out over the next probably 10 days,” Trump said.
> Iran asserts control over the passage of tankers through the Strait of Hormuz, a trading route that facilitates the transport of about 20% of global oil supply.
> The price of crude oil holds major implications for the economy and consumers through its direct effect on costs as an input into products ranging from gasoline to plastics.
> The current oil-price increase may combine with a seasonal price hike for gasoline set to take effect within weeks, since demand for gas typically grows as travel picks up in the warmer spring weather, Patrick de Haan, the head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, said on Thursday in a post on X.
> Still, de Haan added, the potential uptick will “not necessarily cause a 2022-era spike.”
> In 2022, the price of Brent crude surged above $139 per barrel in March, just weeks after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The average price of a U.S. gallon of gasoline stood at about $4.32, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), a federal agency.
> Iran accounts for less than 3% of global oil output, according to the EIA. Sanctions have constrained Iranian oil sales in recent years.
> Even so, a potential military conflict could prompt the closure of the Strait of Hormuz, driving up prices for oil and other goods, experts previously told ABC News.
> The passage marks the only shipping route that stretches from the Persian Gulf to the open ocean, making it a key travel hub for goods originating in oil-rich Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Iran. At its narrowest point, the Strait of Hormuz is just 21 miles wide.
> British police arrest Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor on suspicion of misconduct
> In 2024, an average of about 20 million barrels per day passed through the Strait of Hormuz, which amounts to roughly 20% of liquid petroleum consumed worldwide, according to the EIA.
> The vast majority of oil that passes through the strait is bound for Asian markets. Nearly 5 million barrels of oil arrived in China via the Strait of Hormuz each day in 2024, the EIA said, while about 2 million barrels of such oil ended up in India on a daily basis.
> By comparison, the U.S. imported just 500,000 barrels of oil each day via the Strait of Hormuz.
> The U.S. is a net exporter of crude oil, meaning the country produces more oil than it consumes. Since oil prices are set on a global market, however, U.S. prices move in response to worldwide swings in supply and demand.

> Tech firms led gains across Asian equities Thursday following a positive lead from Wall Street, where traders also welcomed strong US data that suggested the world's top economy remained in rude health.

> Asian stocks are enjoying a strong start to the year as investors turn to the region's relatively cheaper tech plays after Wall Street's AI-fuelled surge over the past two years.
> That has seen the Magnificent Seven market titans including Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft struggle since the start of January, with questions being raised about the wisdom of the vast sums splashed on artificial intelligence.
> Meanwhile, a slew of strong US figures this week -- combined with a forecast-beating jobs report last week -- suggested the Fed might not need to cut rates any time soon.
> That was compounded by the bank's January minutes that saw several officials were open to hiking borrowing costs owing to stubbornly high inflation.

### 3. [Fed Economists Praise Prediction Markets as States Step Up Enforcement](https://decrypt.co/358529/fed-economists-prediction-markets-states-step-up-enforcement)
**Source**: Decrypt | **Date**: 2026-02-19T03:54:00+00:00

> Federal researchers are embracing prediction markets as policy-relevant tools just as state regulators move to curtail them.
> In a working paper, Federal Reserve researchers say macro-focused prediction markets can provide policymakers with a real-time, market-based gauge of inflation and interest-rate expectations.
> The authors found that the models closely match, and even exceed, forecasts from traditional benchmarks while providing continuously updated probability distributions around key data releases and policy meetings.
> Their findings suggest prediction markets can serve as a “valuable complement to existing forecast tools in both research and policy settings,” the authors wrote.
> By offering “transparent, continuously updated, and economically interpretable measures of expectations” with competitive forecast performance, prediction markets could “open new avenues” for studying monetary policy transmission, market sentiment, and macroeconomic uncertainty, the authors said.
> The Fed's study arrives as state regulators intensify scrutiny of prediction markets.
> While Federal Reserve economists describe such contracts as real-time gauges of inflation and rate expectations, a Ninth Circuit ruling on Tuesday cleared the way for Nevada to pursue civil enforcement.
> A request to pause Nevada’s enforcement action against a federally regulated prediction market was denied, allowing the state to move forward while the broader legal dispute continues. The decision complicates and adds weight to an ongoing debate over whether these markets fall under federal commodities law or state gambling regimes.
> While the ruling allows Nevada to proceed with its enforcement case, it is only an interim decision that does not address the merits of the underlying appeal, a person familiar with the matter told Decrypt.
> Supreme Court review, if pursued, would come only after the Ninth Circuit resolves the full appeal, not at this administrative stay stage, Decrypt was told.
> Prediction markets allow participants to buy and sell contracts tied to the outcome of future events, with prices reflecting the implied probability of a given result. These platforms list contracts on elections, economic data releases, and central bank decisions, positioning themselves as tools for aggregating dispersed information into market-based forecasts.
> But the sector has faced mounting regulatory pressure.
> Federal regulators have previously challenged the scope of certain event contracts, while several states have argued that some prediction markets resemble unlicensed gambling operations, prompting cease-and-desist actions and enforcement disputes that now sit alongside the federal oversight framework.
> Industry observers say the paper reveals tensions between prediction markets’ potential and ongoing regulatory uncertainty.
> “Regulatory clarity is helpful, but certainty is never permanent; political and legal environments are always shifting,” Tom Chalmers, CEO of prediction market protocol functionSPACE, told Decrypt. “What matters for prediction markets as forecasting tools is whether participants can operate with enough stability to provide deep, continuous liquidity.”
> The use for gambling is just one of many use cases, Chalmers noted.
> “These markets only function as real-time gauges of inflation or rate expectations if a broad set of informed actors can participate without fearing abrupt shutdowns or jurisdictional conflict,” he said.
> Political backlash has derailed prediction markets before, such as DARPA’s canceled 2003 project, though more structured regulatory frameworks have since enabled compliant, policy-focused versions to operate, Chalmers explained.
> If prediction markets maintain predictive accuracy, Chalmers argues they could offer central banks a real-time gauge of inflation and rate expectations.
> Such a use could “extend to decision markets as those outlined in the vision of Futarchy, where policy makers can go to the market to identify impacts of decisions,” he said, referring to Vitalik Buterin’s 2014 exploration of a governance model that uses prediction markets to forecast the outcomes of policy decisions before they are implemented.
> Chalmers said “there is room” for prediction markets to become “even better forecasting engines,” including through the development of mathematical standards designed to represent full probability distributions, such as variance and skewness, which could provide “vital signals” for policymakers.

### 4. [Gold News: Gold Price Stuck as Iran War Risk Battles Hawkish Fed Minutes](https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/gold-news-gold-price-stuck-as-iran-war-risk-battles-hawkish-fed-minutes-1580551)
**Source**: FX Empire | **Date**: 2026-02-19T13:33:00+00:00

> Spot Gold is inching higher on Thursday as traders assess the risks of a war between the United States and Iran, and the Fed’s somewhat hawkish minutes that were released late Wednesday. It’s a classic battle between the traditional fundamental traders who base gold’s value on Treasury yields and the dollar versus speculators betting on gold as a safe-haven.
> Today’s early muted price action marks a dramatic shift from a month ago when gold was trading at the same price, but being controlled by aggressive speculation. The funny thing is, a month ago traders were pretty confident the Fed would cut rates at least two times in 2026, but there weren’t any U.S. Navy ships off the coast of Iran, standing ready to strike at any time.
> It all comes down to whether you believe gold is an investment or a safe-haven asset. If I had asked you in late January, what would you have done if the Fed took one or two rate cuts off the board in 2026, you would have probably said that news was bearish and may have even taken profits in gold. Guess what, the Fed may have said that in some way on January 28 when it released its monetary policy statement and Fed Chair Powell spoke. The reaction: gold topped at $5602.23 the next day.
> Flash forward to yesterday’s minutes. January’s minutes showed Fed policymakers were in near full agreement to keep the benchmark interest rate on hold. Policymakers were mixed, however, with how to deal with inflation. Some considered hiking rates if inflation persists. Some thought cutting rates while inflation was elevated was a bad move.
> According to the CME’s FedWatch Tool, no one thinks the Fed will cut rates in March and the odds of a rate cut in June after the minutes is about 50.4%.
> Let’s now look at the safe-haven side of gold. If I had told you a month ago that the U.S. had parked three Navy fleets off the coast of Iran including its largest warship and both sides were readying for attack, you would’ve said that’s bullish. Well, we are in this situation now and gold is showing little reaction today after yesterday’s 2% gain.
> Looking ahead, I’m not saying that gold can’t spike higher if the U.S. attacks Iran and a war begins. What I’m trying to point out is that conditions have changed from just a month ago and a different type of trader is in the gold market. Let’s face it, that recent sell-off in gold hurt a lot of small speculators. Additionally, the CME raised margins on gold futures and we have an ongoing Asia holiday. But I think the biggest influence on gold is the uncertainty surrounding the timing of the Fed’s first interest rate cut in 2026. Until this situation is cleared up, gold could remain in a range.
> We expect this consolidation period to possibly extend into June when the new Fed Chair takes over, but we’re also open to periodic speculative swings due to thin liquidity. However, the price action suggests traders are more concerned about the direction of interest rates than geopolitics at this time. Essentially, the safe-haven bid isn’t strong enough right now to overcome the “no rate cuts” reality, so gold is still consolidating.

### 5. [Supreme Court Trump Tariff Ruling Tomorrow: Schedule, Expectations, and Crypto Market Impact?](https://coingape.com/trending/supreme-court-trump-tariff-ruling-tomorrow-schedule-expectations-and-crypto-market-impact/)
**Source**: Coingape | **Date**: 2026-02-19T12:26:00+00:00

> The U.S. Supreme Court is set to release its ruling on the legality of Trump-era tariffs on February 20, 2026. Additional opinion days are scheduled for February 24 and 25. The ruling may have far-reaching consequences for U.S. trade policy as well as international markets, including the crypto market.
> The decision of the court is eagerly anticipated by investors, crypto traders, and policymakers. The case will influence the future trade policy and market conditions.
> The case centers on whether President Trump had the legal authority to impose tariffs using emergency powers.
> Trump imposed these tariffs through the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The legality of the tariffs had been previously ruled out by lower courts. The ruling of the Supreme Court will have far-reaching impacts, both on trade and market sentiment.
> The case will be one of the market movers. In the event that the tariffs are overruled, it would result in less trade uncertainty and fewer inflation concerns.
> 🚨 BREAKING:
> 🇺🇸 SUPREME COURT SETS FEBRUARY 20 AS THE NEXT POSSIBLE DATE FOR THE “TRUMP TARIFF” RULING.#BREAKING #SUPREMECOURT #TRUMPTARIFF pic.twitter.com/jw4myt1s6d
> — Crypto News Hunters 🎯 (@CryptoNewsHntrs) February 13, 2026
> Conversely, the inflation pressures could be high when the tariffs are maintained; this could kill the market optimism. Analysts are of the opinion that this ruling will set off turmoil in the markets, particularly on risky securities such as stocks and crypto.
> Ahead of the Supreme Court ruling, investors and analysts are preparing for potential market swings. Should the court find in favor of Trump in his tariffs, the markets would be relieved. A decrease in tariffs would make business cheaper, which would be beneficial to corporate profitability.
> Any decision in favor of the tariffs would probably reduce inflation concerns, which would be positive for risk-on assets. This is likely to be a positive situation both in the stock market and the crypto market.
> The crypto market is down 2.1% to $2.3T in the last 24 hours, primarily driven by a sharp sell-off. The cryptocurrency market fell in the day following the announcement of hawkishness on the monetary policy by the U.S. Federal Reserve.
> The crypto market is under intense pressure after the FOMC minutes released on Wednesday, when major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP are on prolonged downtrends.
> Bitcoin price is moving steadily downward, continuing to consolidate in a trading range. ETH price hovered around $1,900, indicating that traders are uncertain. XRP price crashed at $1.40 ahead of U.S. tariffs, supported at the lower trendline border, and any breaking below the level implies a future correction.
> The Supreme Court decision may put more strain on cryptocurrencies, as the tariffs are either upheld or invalidated. A decision to prevent the tariffs could lift the inflation concerns, leading to the improvement of the mood in the general market, including crypto.
> Conversely, a move to maintain the tariffs would worsen the existing bearish trend, particularly where inflationary pressures are viewed as high.
> The crypto market is likely to be characterized by major volatility following the ruling, as market participants respond to the decision.

> Simply sign up to the Chinese economy myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.
> The IMF has called for China to slash state support for industry as international concerns mount about overcapacity in the world’s second-largest economy.
> The fund estimated that China spent about 4 per cent of its GDP subsidising companies in critical sectors and said it should reduce that by 2 percentage points in the medium term.
> China’s industrial policies “are giving rise to international spillovers and pressures” and had combined with weak domestic demand to make China “more reliant on manufacturing exports as a source of growth”, the fund said.
> “Industrial policy has enabled tech innovation in some sectors, but overall the impact on the economy has been negative,” said Sonali Jain-Chandra, mission chief at the IMF for China and Asia Pacific, pointing to “resource misallocation” and “overspending”.
> The fund has previously called on China to scale back its industrial policies but has not estimated by how much.
> The recommendations in an IMF report come after China has boosted exports of manufactured goods, including higher-value items such as electric vehicles, which has stirred tensions with the west over its subsidies.
> China’s global trade surplus in goods surpassed $1tn last year. World leaders such as France’s Emmanuel Macron have bemoaned “unbearable imbalances” in trade.
> Some content could not load. Check your internet connection or browser settings.
> The IMF welcomed an initiative from Beijing to reduce “involution”, a term China uses to refer to excessive price competition, but said it should further “clarify its strategy”.
> Policymakers in China are battling challenges, including the threat of deflation, weak consumer confidence, high youth unemployment and a sustained property slowdown that shows few signs of easing.
> The IMF in 2024 called on China to spend 5.5 per cent of GDP over four years to combat the property slowdown by completing unfinished housing and supporting unviable developers’ exit from the sector.
> In the report published this week, it called for 5 per cent of GDP over three years from the central government. “The proposition is essentially the same,” said Thomas Helbling, IMF deputy director for Asia Pacific, who said unfinished properties and the consequences for Chinese investor confidence remained the “elephant in the room”.
> “The hangover from the boom has not been addressed,” he said.
> The IMF also urged China to move towards a “consumption-led growth” model for its economy. It recommended that China loosen restrictions on internal migrants’ access to social welfare, move to a more progressive taxation system and boost pensions.
> In their response to the IMF report, Chinese authorities said their industrial subsidies were not as large-scale as estimates suggested.
> Zhang Zhengxin, the IMF’s executive director for China, a role nominated by the member country, said the nation “believe[s] estimates of the scale and impact of China’s industrial policy are significantly overstated”.
> “China’s industrial policies are open and transparent, apply equally to state-owned enterprises, private firms, and foreign-invested entities,” Zhang said.

### 2. [CEOs see disruption as the norm, AI as an advantage: survey](https://www.eco-business.com/news/ceos-see-disruption-as-the-norm-ai-as-an-advantage-survey/)
**Source**: Eco-Business | **Date**: 2026-02-19T09:33:00+00:00

> Global business leaders are increasingly treating disruption as a permanent feature of the operating environment, a new study finds.
> Although supply chain pressures, geopolitical tensions and technology-driven change remain intense, companies are becoming more adept at responding to them, with persistent disruption gradually being normalised, the 7th annual Disruption Index by AlixPartners shows.
> The survey, which polled 3,200 chief executives (CEO) and senior executives across 11 countries, suggests that while the intensity of disruption has moderated, nearly half of respondents say their businesses were heavily affected over the past year.
> The Disruption Index score is calculated by analysing the number and severity of disruptive forces. This year, the disruption score fell slightly to 70, down three points from last year.
> The 2026 index shows that energy prices, inflation, tariffs, geopolitics and cybersecurity threats remain key stress points whereas artificial intelligence (AI), business-model reinvention and geopolitical repositioning are emerging as critical levers for companies seeking to turn disruption into competitive advantage.
> Globally, China remains the most disrupted market, posting a disruption index of 77 — the highest among the 11 countries surveyed. However, the figure marks the third consecutive annual decline, down from 83 in 2024 and 81 in 2025, signalling a shift from acute turbulence to a more adaptive phase.
> More than half (51 per cent) of executives in China – the highest proportion globally – say they have already made significant changes to their business models in response to ongoing challenges, including economic slowdown, geopolitical tensions and demographic decline.
> These changes focus primarily on accelerating technology adoption, improving profitability and expanding into new markets. Ignatius Tong, partner and managing director and co-leader of Greater China at AlixPartners, said disruption is increasingly viewed as a catalyst rather than a setback.
> “Disruption is not a setback – it is a catalyst for growth. Companies in China are demonstrating agility in today’s extraordinary environment, driving some of the world’s most ambitious transformation agendas,” Tong said, noting that many Chinese companies are pursuing overseas expansion to unlock new opportunities and drive sustainable growth.
> Energy and power generation, retail, and financial services were identified as the three most disrupted sectors in China this year. Meanwhile, China’s automotive industry recorded a 12 per cent year-on-year decline in its disruption index, although it remains the most disrupted industry globally due to slower growth, intense competition and persistently high costs.
> Globally, eight in 10 executives say they are optimistic about AI’s long-term impact. In China, confidence is even stronger, with 90 per cent expressing optimism.
> Heavy investment in AI has placed China among the global leaders in deployment. Some 38 per cent of Chinese executives say they are extremely confident in AI’s potential to drive growth, particularly through automation of physical processes and robotics.
> In terms of investment, among the 60 per cent of Chinese executives increasing digital spending this year, more than a third (36 per cent) cite AI as their primary focus. Operational automation is emerging as a key opportunity, with 77 per cent highlighting the automation of physical processes and expecting humanoid robots to be deployed at scale within five years.
> Despite these trends, executives are mindful of the risks of AI. 95 per cent of CEOs expect AI to lead to layoffs within five years, including 44 per cent who project workforce reductions of 10 per cent or more within their organisations. In addition, 38 per cent warn that excessive reliance on AI could erode employees’ critical thinking and problem-solving skills.
> Stephen Yu, partner and managing director and co-leader of Greater China at AlixPartners, noted that AI is reshaping the C-suite agenda but brings new governance and workforce challenges.
> “What distinguishes true AI leaders is their ability to act decisively – embedding clear governance and robust risk management frameworks, while investing in employee resilience to ensure AI is deployed both successfully and responsibly,” he said.
> The report also finds that the fastest-growing companies are responding to ongoing uncertainty with more decisive action than their peers.
> Nearly three-quarters (73 per cent) of global executives say they have diversified supplier and trading partner networks to cope with tariffs. In China, 48 per cent report similar adjustments.
> Growth leaders are also reshaping product portfolios and ramping up compliance spending. Around 59 per cent have increased investment in risk management and regulatory compliance, while 78 per cent say they are changing strategies in response to evolving US-China relations – significantly outpacing less agile competitors.
> As disruption becomes the norm, the report suggests that competitive advantage will hinge less on weathering shocks and more on the speed and boldness with which companies adapt to them.

### 3. [Can India Power the AI Dream?](https://thediplomat.com/2026/02/can-india-power-the-ai-dream/)
**Source**: The Diplomat | **Date**: 2026-02-19T14:08:00+00:00

> Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the inauguration of the India AI Impact Expo 2026 at Bharat Mandapam in New Delhi.
> India is hosting a massive global AI Impact Summit between February 16-20, with over 20 heads of state, 60 ministers, and around 500 global technology leaders attending. There is huge optimism, driven by the government, about India being at the forefront of the defining technology of this century. Many view artificial intelligence (AI) as the 21st century’s equivalent of the steamship or the airplane in the 20th. However, it is worth examining what AI actually entails and the less visible costs associated with it.
> Early last year, the southern states of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh competed to host global technology giant Google’s AI processing center. The $15 billion project eventually went to Andhra. Telangana soon entered the race after Microsoft committed $17.5 billion to establish a similar center in Hyderabad. These investment promises quickly became political talking points. At the national level, the Union government announced a major push for artificial intelligence through its IndiaAI Mission in 2024.
> Yet, the implications of India’s rush to embrace AI need to be taken into consideration.
> Steve Jobs once described computers as “bicycles for the mind,” tools that augmented human capabilities in calculation and information processing. Artificial intelligence represents a qualitative shift from this role. Rather than merely assisting humans or augmenting their capabilities, AI systems can increasingly perform tasks such as writing, coding, data analysis, and generating images and videos autonomously. Large language models and agentic AI are already reshaping how work is organized and how productivity gains are achieved.
> The speed at which AI is reducing demand for traditional labor is becoming evident. Demand for entry-level tech workers is already declining, with media reports indicating a sharp fall in the hiring of new graduates. One report from Eastern Europe mentioned that there are on average as many as 149 candidates for a single IT job. Combined with tighter immigration policies in the U.S., a similar slowdown in labor demand is now visible in India’s IT sector.
> At the same time, investment in AI companies such as Nvidia continues unabated. However, it remains unclear how this investment will translate into a corresponding increase in consumption or output. Although India, too, has joined what many describe as the “AI bandwagon,” demand-side outcomes remain uncertain.
> There is also the critical question of sustainable capacity. AI data centers are highly resource-intensive, particularly in terms of electricity and water for cooling. Does India have the capacity to support such infrastructure?
> A closer look at Andhra Pradesh offers some insight.
> As of January 2026, the state’s total installed capacity was 21.1 gigawatts (GW), with 37 percent from renewables, 48 percent from thermal power, and 14 percent from hydroelectric sources. Existing generation capacity cannot be redeployed to meet the requirement from data centers, since it is already committed to serving current demand and peak-load obligations.
> The official power generation target for AI data centers in Andhra Pradesh is an installed capacity of 6 GW by 2030. If these centers operate continuously, their annual energy requirement would be approximately 52,560 GW-hours (GWh). This amounts to nearly 77 percent of the state’s total electricity consumption in 2024, which stood at 68,626 GWh. However, this comparison of annual energy figures is misleading unless one also considers the timing and reliability of supply.
> Assuming an unrealistically high 100 percent efficiency in converting installed capacity into usable power, meeting this target would require the power system to supply a near-constant load equivalent to 6 GW dedicated solely to data centers. This is over and above  the state’s existing electricity demand, which fluctuates over the day and across seasons and is partly met by intermittent sources.
> However, this figure accounts only for the IT equipment. Additional power is required for overheads such as cooling and auxiliary systems. Calculating the total power requirement using the global average Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) of 1.56, the figure rises to 9.36 GW. In practice, the required generation capacity would be even higher once plant efficiency and transmission losses are considered. Expressed in energy terms, a continuous load of 9.36 GW corresponds to roughly 81,994 GWh per year, far above the 68,626 GWh consumed in 2024.
> The challenge is not just augmenting annual energy availability. Data centers require continuous, reliable power. Renewable sources such as solar and wind cannot provide this without storage. Andhra Pradesh would therefore need to add significant thermal, nuclear, or large hydroelectric capacity.
> Even if work on new thermal power projects were to begin immediately, the gestation period would be at least five years, excluding delays related to land acquisition, environmental clearances, and financing. Nuclear projects would take even longer. Under these conditions, meeting Andhra Pradesh’s 2030 data center targets appears highly challenging.
> This challenge is not unique to India. In the United States, counties such as Chandler and Tucson in Arizona have rejected AI data center proposals due to their power demands. Similar concerns have emerged in Georgia, Maine, and Indiana. In Oregon, some proposals require data center developers to bear the capital costs of new utility infrastructure.
> Despite its constraints, India remains an attractive destination for the AI business due to its large pool of software professionals and the vast volumes of data generated by its population – both essential inputs for training AI models.
> However, as the initial euphoria over large foreign investments in AI capacity subsides, and the demands of the industry scale up, the basic question of India’s absorptive capacity will require careful consideration.

### 4. [Travel and tourism gallops confidently into the Year of the Horse](https://www.ttgasia.com/2026/02/19/travel-and-tourism-gallops-confidently-into-the-year-of-the-horse/)
**Source**: TTG Asia | **Date**: 2026-02-19T07:28:00+00:00

> Hotel groups across Asia-Pacific are reporting record signings and strong development pipelines, underscoring confidence in the region’s growth
> Travel spending remains resilient, with consumers continuing to prioritise travel despite geopolitical and economic uncertainties
> Industry forecasts point to sustained growth, with rising international arrivals and strengthening intra-Asia travel through 2027
> Despite a backdrop of intensifying geopolitical tensions, travel and tourism business leaders in Asia-Pacific are stepping into 2026 with optimism.
> Coming off another year of  “exceptional year of growth and development momentum”, Marriott International’s Asia-Pacific excluding China (APEC) team expects strong performance in 2026 and forward.
> The company’s 2025 performance report for the APEC region, issued on February 12, boasted the third consecutive year of record-breaking development activity. There were 187 organic deals representing more than 28,000 rooms signed in 2025, a 32 per cent year-over-year increase. And the company closed the year with more than more than 730 open properties across 22 countries in APEC, spanning 27 brands, and with more than 400 hotels and over 86,000 rooms in the development pipeline.
> Commenting on the 2025 results, Rajeev Menon, president, Asia-Pacific excluding China, Marriott International, said he remains “pretty optimistic and bullish (about) our part of the region”.
> Another lodging heavyweight in Asia-Pacific, Ascott, signed a record 19,000 units across 102 properties in 2025, marking 27 per cent year-on-year growth. Its portfolio expansion has resulted in entry into new destinations in the region, such as Wellington (New Zealand), Phuket (Thailand), Langkawi (Malaysia), and Lucknow (India).
> Simon Cameron, founder of luxury travel agency, Lightfoot Travel, who sees continued appetite for travel among high-net-worth clients, said travel interest in Asia-Pacific destinations can be inferred from the rate of luxury hotel development in the region.
> “Look at the number of Shangri-Las, Amans, Rosewoods and Mandarin Orientals that have opened or are opening here,” said Cameron, adding that airline expansion into new destinations are also spurring travel interest and contributing to tourism growth.
> Travel spend holds strong
> Simon Baptist, principal economist, Visa Asia Pacific, told TTG Asia that Asia-Pacific bears a “generally resilient outlook”.
> “Our latest indicators, including the Spending Momentum Index (SMI) Report for 4Q2025, show a region moving in different gears: some markets are easing after very strong rebounds, while others are stabilising as cost pressures moderate. What’s most notable is that spending patterns are being shaped less by a single regional trend and more by local factors, from household purchasing power to price sensitivity and category‑level shifts,” Baptist explained.
> Due to VUCA conditions, he expects spending confidence to remain uneven across Asia in 2026. While some households adjust to higher living costs, others are benefiting from stronger labour markets and stabilising economic conditions.
> He added: “Across emerging Asia, we see spending growth normalising after a strong surge in 2024 and early 2025 in many markets. Indonesia and Thailand eased more sharply, while India and Vietnam moderated more gradually. This looks less like a slowdown and more like a return to a sustainable pace as post‑pandemic effects fade.
> “So, even in a VUCA environment, consumption in Asia remains resilient, though drivers differ by market, ranging from tourism to wage conditions to inflation.”
> In a world of growing geopolitical tensions, Menon regards “hospitality (as) the frontline troops of the economy” – it thrives in times of peace and stability.
> “Yet, something has changed after the pandemic,” he said. “People are putting a higher priority on travel over other expenses. This isn’t a short-term trend. It is clear in every research and credit card data that around the world people are prioritising travel and experiences well over many other expense items on their day to day basis.”
> Menon also highlighted the growing attention the region is getting for its economic progress, which has a positive impact on travel consumption.
> “Due to investments in South-east Asia and South Asia from Western and Chinese sources, this region has seen a real emergence of the middle-class over the last six to eight years. These people are acquiring wealth, they are aspirational, they want to travel – all of which bode well for the world of hospitality,” he stated.
> Illustrating the value of intra-Asia travel, Menon shared that Marriott International’s APEC room night mix was dominated by APEC travellers in 2025 – the segment made up 56.4 per cent of the total. India (29 per cent), Japan (15 per cent), Australia (11 per cent), South Korea (nine per cent), and Indonesia (eight per cent), formed the top five APEC source markets of travellers.
> “Once, we had to rely heavily on other parts of the world to bring travellers to our region. Today, almost 57 per cent of the business in our world is being generated in Asia-Pacific excluding China,” he stated.
> The economic importance of Asia-Pacific can be seen from the way global analysts are regarding the region. Menon noted that analysts used to look at how China’s activities were impacting the rest of Asia-Pacific a decade ago. In recent years, however, analysts have been reviewing APEC’s development as a standalone entity, and placing as much importance on the region when compared to China.
> Travel tech firm Klook’s latest Travel Pulse research, conducted with consumer insights platform GWI and involving 11,000 respondents globally, supports observations of a resilient travel appetite. It found that 88 per cent of respondents plan on either maintaining or increasing their travel budgets in 2026.
> “We hear a lot of talk about recession, intensifying economic pressure, and rising cost of living, so this intention to travel and spend is a very, very positive sign,” remarked Marcus Yong, vice president global marketing at Klook.
> Travel intention is stronger among Asia-Pacific respondents (64 per cent) compared to those in the west (43 per cent). Travellers from Indonesia, India, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam are found to be most willing to splurge on travel this year.
> The Singapore travel market is also one to watch, according to Yong, as residents in the city-state lead the way in terms of expected travel spend in 2026.
> According to the Travel Pulse research, travellers from Singapore are expected to spend US$2,500 on their next trip this year, compared to US$2,089 and US$2,080 by travellers from Hong Kong and China, respectively.
> “Asia continues to be the heartbeat of where all this is happening,” commented Yong, adding that Asia-Pacific travellers are two times more likely than their western counterparts to spend more on destination experiences.
> Sixty-one per cent of respondents also intend to make a trip within the first half of the new year compared to 50 per cent who said the same in 2025.
> While civil unrest have caused some clients to reconsider destinations, Cameron said there were many other destinations for travellers to choose from, allowing holidays to proceed.
> Encouraging projections
> Industry players’ confidence in Asia-Pacific’s travel and tourism health is backed by further data.
> PATA’s Asia Pacific Visitor Forecasts 2025–2027 report, updated in mid-2025, tracked an encouraging and continuous improvement in international visitor arrivals (IVAs) to Asia-Pacific. IVAs are expected to reach 801 million by 2027 in a realistic medium scenario, up from 692 million in 2025.
> The forecast, produced in collaboration with the Hospitality and Tourism Research Centre of the School of Hotel and Tourism Management at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, acknowledges the volatile environment that travel and tourism operates in.
> The study found that Asia-Pacific region’s tourism performance will return to pre-Covid levels even under a severe projection scenario.
> Euromonitor International’s Top 100 City Destinations Index 2025, published last December, also highlighted strong growth in IVAs to Asia-Pacific. It marked Asia-Pacific as the second-largest region for international arrivals, recording the fastest growth globally with inbound trips rising 10 per cent to surpass 350 million.
> Hot destinations, according to the index, include Bangkok, Hong Kong, Macau, Tokyo, Singapore, and Seoul.
> It said that tourism momentum across the region was supported by visa relaxations, infrastructure upgrades, and high-profile cultural and sporting events, strengthening connectivity and enhancing visitor experiences.
> Navigating the new era of corporate travel in 2026
> Global Tourism Economy Forum 2025 heads to Harbin
> New opportunities to connect with luxury buyers in Europe

### 5. [India AI Impact Summit begins](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366639262/India-AI-Impact-Summit-begins)
**Source**: Computer Weekly | **Date**: 2026-02-19T10:45:00+00:00

> The fourth global Artificial Intelligence (AI) Summit has begun in India under the banner of “bringing the world together”, marking the first time the event has been hosted in a Global South country.
> The summit’s programme is organised around seven interconnected focus areas (or Chakras) that aim to foster greater multilateral cooperation around AI development, while translating three broader principles (or Sutras) of people, planet and progress into concrete areas of action.
> These seven areas include safety and trust, democratising resources, and AI for economic development and social good.
> Inaugurating the five-day summit, Indian prime minister Narendra Modi declared: “AI must be anchored in human values and aligned with humanity’s collective progress.”
> He added: “India has the talent and entrepreneurial energy to become an AI powerhouse, not just as a consumer, but a creator.”
> In line with the focus of this year’s summit, panel discussions will revolve around infrastructure, safety, digital public goods and cross-border cooperation.
> The Indian government will also release thematic “casebooks” covering AI in health, energy, education, agriculture, gender empowerment and disabilities, which will showcase a variety of real-world AI applications that industry and policymakers can learn from.
> Touted as the biggest AI summit yet, the Indian government said it is expecting 250,000 visitors, including 20 national leaders, 45 ministerial-level delegations and numerous figures from the global technology sector.
> This includes French president Emmanuel Macron and Brazilian president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, along with Google chief executive Sundar Pichai, Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Microsoft president Brad Smith.
> From the UK, the delegation will include deputy prime minister David Lammy and AI minister Kanishka Narayan.
> While the inaugural AI Summit held at Bletchley Park in 2023 focused squarely on the safety of cutting-edge AI systems, subsequent summits held in South Korea and France expanded the remit to also focus on inclusion, governance and innovation.
> Now, the India AI Impact Summit will revolve largely around addressing the fundamental gap that persists between the inclusive rhetoric around AI and the reality on the ground.
> “The global AI divide continues to widen, with AI resources and capabilities concentrated among select nations and corporations. This concentration fundamentally limits the development of social, cultural and linguistically contextual AI solutions, constraining AI’s potential to accelerate progress toward our collective development goals, especially for the Global South,” said the summit organisers.
> “Simultaneously, AI’s rapid proliferation across society is creating new challenges that demand urgent attention: disrupting traditional employment patterns, exacerbating existing biases and driving exponential increases in energy consumption.
> “These developments underscore the urgent need to move beyond aspirational frameworks toward concrete, measurable impact that addresses both AI’s promise and its perils.”
> Unlike previous events, the India summit has evolved into an all-purpose trade show, with exhibition halls displaying diagnostic tools powered by machine learning, agritech platforms promising precision for small farmers, multilingual language models tuned to India’s linguistic diversity, and public service dashboards designed to streamline governance.
> However, the previous AI Impact Summits have not resulted in joint binding political agreements, with Apar Gupta, founder director of the Internet Freedom Foundation (IFF), warning that this latest edition risks being little more than a spectacle if policy does not match rhetoric.
> “Perhaps, if the summit is viewed more pragmatically across the hundreds of events and the flood of emails and PDFs it will generate, it should be mostly understood as spectacle,” he wrote.
> “Here, the slogan of AI providing ‘welfare for all, happiness for all’ matches the massive scale of event organising as a communications objective to produce narratives at volume.
> “With Delhi hotel rooms touching $6,000 a night, it is a reasonable forecast that the summit will prioritise the interests of power and profit, not only across the hundreds of panels and talks, but also in the deal-making that will be done behind closed doors.”
> The opening day was also marred by complaints of poor organisation and crowd management, with India’s information technology minister Ashwini Vaishnaw having to apologise to exhibitors for “any issues or inconvenience” as social media was flooded with complaints.
> Many exhibitors complained, for example, that security sweeps and last-minute closures left them stranded outside the exhibition halls, while some even complained of their products being stolen from the venue.
> The UK is expected to use the summit to redouble efforts to use AI to transform public services, create jobs and drive renewal for people worldwide.
> According to the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT), deputy prime minister Lammy will speak on a high-level panel on the last day of the summit about unlocking opportunity through global languages, announcing UK support for an African Language Hub that will enable AI to work in 40 African languages.
> It is one of three projects being announced as part of the £100m AI for Development (AI4D) programme, aimed at ensuring South Asian and African countries benefit from the AI revolution.
> “AI is the defining technology of our generation – and we’re determined to make sure it delivers for everyone,” said AI minister Narayan. “It can cut waiting times, transform public services, create new jobs and give hard-working communities a fresh start – and that’s exactly the message we’re taking to the summit.
> “It is central to our plans for delivering national renewal, but its benefits can’t and shouldn’t be reserved for the few.”
> However, last year’s summit in Paris ended with the US and the UK refusing to sign a joint international declaration on inclusive and sustainable AI, including promoting accessibility to reduce digital divides between rich and developing countries.
> While the UK government failed to provide an exact reason for its refusal to sign the statement, a spokesperson for Starmer said at the time that the government would “only ever sign up to initiatives that are in UK national interests”.
> The emphasis placed on deregulation by US vice-president JD Vance and other key political figures led some to argue that they were setting the stage for a “race to the bottom” on AI regulation.
> Vance, for example, rebuked European efforts to curb AI’s risks, warning that excessive regulation could hobble the rapidly growing AI industry. He also criticised cooperation with China, as well as any regulation that threatens the interests of US companies.
> “We feel very strongly that AI must remain free from ideological bias and that American AI will not be co-opted into a tool for authoritarian censorship,” he said.
> In the run-up to the summit, the Indian cabinet approved a $1.1bn state-backed venture capital programme that will channel government money into startups through private investors, doubling down on its effort to finance high-risk areas such as artificial intelligence, advanced manufacturing and other sectors broadly referred to by the industry as deep tech.
> IT minister Vaishnaw highlighted the scale of India’s startup expansion, noting that the number of startups has grown from fewer than 500 in 2016 to more than 200,000 today. More than 49,000 startups were registered in 2025 alone, the highest annual number on record.
> This builds on the IndiaAI initiative launched in late 2024 to build an ecosystem that fosters AI development, with a particular focus on democratising access, improving data quality, attracting talent and promoting ethical approaches.
> With a population of 1.4 billion and one of the largest digital user bases in the world, Modi highlighted at the summit India’s transformative potential in the AI revolution, noting the country could leverage these foundations to craft AI pathways distinct from those of the Western and Chinese models.
> “We are not just nurturing talent, but we are building the infrastructure, policy ecosystem and skills base required for India to move from participating in the AI revolution to shaping it,” said Vaishnaw.
> India has a large tech workforce, and has attracted some big infrastructure investments from the likes of Google, Nvidia and Amazon.
> While there are significant AI hubs in India, including in Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Mumbai, the world’s biggest US AI chatbots do not work in all of India’s 22 official languages, let alone the hundreds of dialects that exist within them. To counter this, India is building its own sovereign AI platforms. However, progress has been relatively slow.
> The 2026 International AI safety report noted that while “in some countries over 50% of the population uses AI, across much of Africa, Asia and Latin America, adoption rates likely remain below 10%”.
> The summit’s rhetoric of “democratising AI and bridging the AI divide” has been criticised by global policy researchers for obscuring troubling domestic realities.
> A recent joint report by the Centre for the Study of Organised Hate and the IFF warned of a stark disconnect between India’s official AI rhetoric and the ground reality.
> It highlighted how AI-enabled hate, discrimination, surveillance, repression and violence against minority and marginalised communities is occurring in an overall environment of democratic backsliding.
> IFF founder director Gupta highlighted that India has already signalled a deregulatory and technocratic approach to AI technologies.
> In January 2026, the chief minister of Maharashtra, the second-most populous state in India, announced it had been developing an AI tool to identify “suspected Bangladeshis” and Rohingya refugees based on language and speech patterns.
> This comes amidst a wider context of inhumane and wrongful deportations of Bengali-speaking Muslim citizens to Bangladesh under the guise of being illegal immigrants.
> Experts have criticised building such a tool, warning it could become an instrument to discriminate against low-income migrant workers from Assam and West Bengal.
> With nearly 30 million Bengali-origin Muslim Indians increasingly susceptible to police brutality, the use of predictive policing algorithms risks automating and amplifying existing biases.
> Muslim minorities, Caste-oppressed Dalit and indigenous Adivasi communities constitute a disproportionate majority of the “undertrials” in India’s prisons – this refers to an accused person who is being held in custody by a court of law and is awaiting trial for a crime, who make up 75% of the Indian prison population.
> Just a week before the India AI Impact Summit, a state unit of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) uploaded an AI-generated video on its official X account, depicting the chief minister of Assam, a northeastern state slated for elections, shooting at two visibly Muslim men.

### 1. [US-Iran tensions spur temporary oil price volatility](https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2026/02/20/us-iran-tensions-spur-temporary-oil-price-volatility)
**Source**: The Star | **Date**: 2026-02-19T20:30:00+00:00

> PETALING JAYA: The heightened US-Iran tensions have increased volatility in the energy market, but the price impact will likely be temporary unless underlying supply and demand fundamentals change in a sustained manner.
> MBSB Research noted that the short-term geopolitical risk premium has risen following the move by Iran to temporarily close the parts of the Strait of Hormuz for live-fire military exercises.
> The Strait facilitate the transit of 20% of global oil flows, and the move marks a rare escalation and has not happened since the Iran–Iraq war in the 1980s.
> “While Iran’s actions underscore the latent geopolitical risk embedded in global energy markets, the current incident appears tactical rather than structural.
> “Unless disruptions to the Strait of Hormuz become sustained or escalate into direct military confrontation, the impact is expected to remain short-lived, consistent with prior geopolitical flare-ups observed in recent years,” the research house commented in a report on the issue.
> Furthermore, this move comes as the presence of multiple US aircraft carriers in the region coincides with both countries trying to negotiate a settlement to Iran’s nuclear programme and military capabilities.
> Brent crude futures prices moved decisively higher on Iranian action, surpassing the US$70 a barrel level on the development, but are well below the one-year high of US$82.03 per barrel.
> MBSB Research suggests the price action reflects a risk premium rather than a structural shift in underlying supply and demand fundamentals.
> It thus has maintained its neutral stance on the oil and gas sector to reflect the challenging macroeconomic backdrop.
> The research house added the stance reinforces its view that crude oil prices will remain depressed as the market continues to grapple with a structural surplus of supply, which is expected to cap sustained upside despite intermittent geopolitical-driven price movements.
> MBSB Research’s top sector pick remains Dialog Group Bhd with a buy call and target price of RM2.17 a share.
> “We favour Dialog for its defensive midstream exposure, anchored by its extensive tank terminal and infrastructure assets.
> “The group’s earnings profile is largely underpinned by long-term take-or-pay contracts and lease arrangements, providing stable and recurring cash flows that are largely insulated from short-term crude price volatility,” it stated.

### 2. [As oil prices spike on US-Iran tensions, Goldman says investors are bracing for more volatility](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/oil-prices-iran-goldman-sachs-trump-economy-energy-crude-futures-2026-2)
**Source**: Markets Insider | **Date**: 2026-02-19T16:13:00+00:00

> Oil is spiking on the latest bout of tensions between the US and Iran, and Goldman Sachs's top commodities researcher says more volatility may be coming.
> Daan Struyven, the bank's co-head of global commodities research, told CNBC that he thinks the market sees tensions escalating further between the US and Iran, a likely catalyst for price hikes and longer-term volatility. Both US and international oil prices were up about 2% on Thursday.
> "Both prediction markets and oil markets are pricing some near-term moderate escalation as the base case," he said.
> One area in focus is the Strait of Hormuz, a waterway in the Middle East that handles 20% of both the global oil and liquified natural gas supplies.
> Struyven highlighted the passage's importance for international oil flows, adding that Goldman's base case assumes shipping through the strait will continue and that his team is not anticipating any long-term disruptions.
> However, Iran is one of the world's leading oil suppliers, and its government has made it clear that it intends to retaliate if President Donald Trump moves forward with his threats against it. This could mean attempting to block or restrict access to the Strait of Hormuz, throttling supply.
> If this were to curtail flows by 1 million barrels per day for an entire year, Struyven predicted that would justify an $8 per barrel price increase, a roughly 11% jump from Thursday's price for Brent crude around $71.50. However, he also noted that fear among traders could push prices even higher, adding to the volatility in the market.
> "Markets are continuously reassessing, not only the base case, but especially the probability of this tail risk of large oil disruptions in the Middle East," he said.
> Oil prices have risen this year after tumbling throughout 2025. The volatility in energy markets follows bouts of volatility related to the US attack on Venezuela in January and continued saber-rattling on Iran.

> Economist and longtime Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff warned that Bitcoin could collapse to $20,000 if the asset loses key support near $50,000.
> His comments come as geopolitical tensions escalate following reports that the US military is preparing strike options against Iran.
> If Bitcoin breaks $50K, which looks likely, it seems highly likely it will at least test $20K. That would be an 84% drop from its ATH. I know Bitcoin has done that before, but never with so much hype, leverage, institutional ownership, and market cap at stake. Sell Bitcoin now!
> Schiff argued that a drop below $50,000 now appears likely and could trigger a much deeper decline. He suggested Bitcoin may repeat historic crash patterns seen in previous cycles, even despite increased institutional adoption and broader mainstream interest.
> His warning arrives as Bitcoin trades near $66,000, down sharply from its recent cycle highs.
> Schiff has remained one of Bitcoin’s most consistent skeptics for over a decade. He has repeatedly described Bitcoin as a speculative bubble and argued that it lacks intrinsic value.
> Throughout previous bull markets, he predicted major crashes, while continuing to promote gold as a superior store of value.
> However, Bitcoin has also repeatedly recovered from severe corrections and reached new highs over time.
> His latest warning comes at a fragile moment for crypto markets. Global risk sentiment has weakened amid fears of potential US military action against Iran.
> Historically, Bitcoin often falls in the early phase of geopolitical shocks as investors reduce exposure to volatile assets.
> On-chain data supports the view that short-term weakness remains possible. The Short-Term Holder SOPR indicator currently sits below 1, showing that recent buyers are selling at a loss.
> This reflects fear and ongoing capitulation among weaker investors.
> At the same time, another key metric tells a different story. Bitcoin’s short-term Sharpe ratio has dropped to extremely negative levels.
> This suggests Bitcoin has already experienced unusually poor returns relative to volatility.
> In past cycles, such conditions often appeared near local bottoms rather than the beginning of prolonged collapses.

> This creates a mixed outlook. While geopolitical stress and weak sentiment could push Bitcoin lower in the short term, much of the speculative excess appears already flushed out.
> Schiff’s prediction reflects rising uncertainty—but on-chain data suggests the market may be closer to a reset phase than the start of a full-scale collapse.

### 4. [Gold vs Bitcoin: Middle East Conflict Fears Boost Gold While Bitcoin Slides](https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/gold-vs-bitcoin-middle-east-conflict-fears-boost-gold-while-bitcoin-slides-1580521)
**Source**: FX Empire | **Date**: 2026-02-19T09:10:00+00:00

> The financial markets are responding to increased geopolitical tensions in Middle East. According to some reports, the United States may be on the verge of direct military confrontation with Iran. This possibility is altering behaviour for investors across asset classes. Gold (XAU) and silver (XAG) prices are rallying due to the safe haven demand while the oil price is rising due to fears of supply. On the other hand, Bitcoin (BTC) is dropping as traders rotate out of risk sensitive assets.
> According to the recent intelligence and media reports, any escalation of conflict this time will be larger and last for weeks. This outlook is raising concerns about long term volatility of commodities, equities, and cryptocurrencies.
> The military presence has also been reported to increase tremendously in the region with several aircraft carriers, warships, fighter jets and air defence systems deployed. A significant number of cargo flights carrying weapons and ammunition have been observed.
> This development is sensitive to markets. Oil prices have risen above $65 per barrel on supply disruption concerns. The sudden move in the energy market will be translated into global financial market.
> Commodity markets have been the most immediate beneficiaries of risk premiums in geopolitics. Gold, silver and oil all advanced as tensions ratcheted, with precious metals experiencing among the strongest reactions. Gold has been holding above $5,000 while silver (XAG) and platinum (XPL) are building bullish momentum.
> The weekly chart for spot gold shows the formation of a strong bullish hammer above the ascending broadening wedge pattern. This formation indicates that the gold price is entering the next phase of growth, which will likely continue further upside in the next few months. The emergence of the ascending broadening wedge pattern indicates increased volatility, which may introduce strong moves in gold.
> The Bitcoin price moved in the opposite direction from safe havens. The price dropped below key support level of around $75,000 and traded lower. This divergence between gold and Bitcoin is becoming more apparent during this period of geopolitical stress.
> When uncertainty increases, institutional and macro investors move capital first into commodities and government bonds. Cryptocurrencies are usually under selling pressure during first phase of fear-induced market movements.
> The Bitcoin price has broken $75,000 and reached $50,000-$55,000 in February. This drop is structural, as seen by the formation of a rounding top pattern at $120,000 and then the formation of bear flag pattern.
> These bearish patterns introduced strong drop in Bitcoin. The price is now approaching $50,000-$55,000, which is the strong support of the ascending broadening pattern. Therefore, the bitcoin price will likely rebound from this level. A break above $100,000 is required to complete this correction.
> The current divergence between gold and Bitcoin points to a recurring pattern in times of geopolitical stress. The precious metals tend to be the first to react as investors fear for their money. On the other hand, cryptocurrencies are typically seen reflecting caution and lowering of risk appetites in first stages of uncertainty.
> The bitcoin to gold ratio further tells the story of price movement in both assets. The ratio has formed a topping pattern at the historical reversal zone and initiated a drop. After breaking from the 29 level in October 2025, the ratio has dropped to the first support at the 13 level. A break below this level will likely initiate further downside towards the 9 level. This breakdown in the ratio indicates strong gold price momentum as compared to Bitcoin.
> The emergence of triangle is further clear on the log scale chart, which shows the 13 and 9 levels as the most important support levels. As the ratio approaches the 9 level, the bitcoin price may attempt to form a bottom pattern.
> The Bitcoin to gold ratio has been trading in cyclical patterns. It has been forming the ascending triangle pattern each time after the bitcoin price peak. It is observed that Bitcoin peaks in November 2013, December 2017, April 2021, and January 2025, which were accompanied by a strong reversal in the ratio. However, when ratio breaks the ascending triangle pattern, Bitcoin leads and continues to trend higher.
> Gold and Bitcoin are responding very differently to the increase in geopolitical risks. Investors are moving into safe haven assets while Bitcoin is coming under pressure due to weaker risk appetite. This divergence indicates that in times of fear capital first looks for stability before moving back into higher-risk assets. Gold is enjoying good momentum and Bitcoin is attempting to find a bottom near key support levels. The gold to Bitcoin ratio also promises this rotation in favour of precious metals. Looking forward, the direction of both assets will depend on whether tensions escalate or ease.

### 5. [Dalal Street snaps rally; Sensex tanks over 1,200 points, Nifty cracks key support](https://www.newindianexpress.com/business/2026/Feb/19/dalal-street-snaps-rally-sensex-tanks-over-1200-points-nifty-cracks-key-support)
**Source**: The New Indian Express | **Date**: 2026-02-19T05:45:00+00:00

> Indian equity markets ended Thursday (February 19) on a sharply weaker note as a broad-based sell-off erased gains from the previous sessions and pulled benchmark indices decisively lower. The BSE Sensex declined by about 1,236 points from the previous close to end near 82,500, while the NSE Nifty 50 fell by roughly 365 points, settling around 25,450.
> The decline marked one of the steepest single-day falls in recent weeks, reflecting a sudden shift in sentiment driven by global risk aversion, profit booking and renewed macroeconomic concerns. The sharp point-wise decline reflected broad-based selling pressure and a clear shift towards risk aversion during the session.
> After opening on a mildly positive note, markets quickly lost momentum as selling pressure intensified through the day, particularly in the afternoon trade. The late-session weakness suggested institutional investors turning cautious rather than retail-led volatility.
> Sectoral performance underscored the risk-off mood. Banking and financial stocks were among the biggest drags, with heavyweight lenders facing sustained selling amid concerns over valuation comfort and global interest rate uncertainty. Auto stocks also came under pressure, reflecting worries over demand sustainability and rising input costs, while FMCG names, which had recently provided defensive support to the indices, failed to hold ground as investors cut exposure across the board. Metals and realty stocks declined as well, mirroring weakness in global commodity cues and higher bond yields.
> The broader market fared worse than the benchmarks, with mid-cap and small-cap indices registering sharper percentage losses. Market breadth was decisively negative, indicating that the selling was not confined to a handful of large stocks but spread widely across sectors and market capitalisations. This pattern suggested a clear preference for capital preservation rather than selective rotation.
> "Volatility spiked on Thursday as India VIX (volatility index) rose 7.45% to 13.13 amid Sensex F&O expiry. The correction was further aggravated by rising crude prices, escalating US–Iran geopolitical tensions, and mixed signals from the US Fed minutes, which added to global uncertainty," said Hariprasad K, SEBI-registered Research Analyst and Founder, Livelong Wealth.
> He added that the move reflects volatility-driven profit booking and global risk repricing rather than a structural reversal. "However, with key supports breached and volatility elevated, markets may remain cautious and range-bound with a negative bias in the immediate term," Hariprasad said.
> From a macro perspective, global developments weighed heavily on sentiment. Heightened geopolitical tensions overseas, coupled with firm crude oil prices, raised concerns about inflationary pressures for oil-importing economies like India. At the same time, uncertainty over the trajectory of global interest rates and the timing of any policy easing by major central banks added to investor caution. These external factors amplified domestic profit booking after a short-lived rally earlier in the week.
> Technically, the breach of key support levels on the Nifty reinforced the bearish undertone. The inability of the market to hold early gains and the sharp increase in intraday volatility pointed to nervous positioning ahead of upcoming global cues. Traders appeared unwilling to carry aggressive long positions, leading to accelerated selling once support zones gave way.
> In terms of near-term outlook, market participants are likely to remain cautious. While sharp declines often invite bargain hunting, sustained recovery will depend on stabilisation in global markets, clarity on interest rate expectations and easing of geopolitical risks. Until then, volatility is expected to remain elevated, with stock-specific moves driven more by risk management than fresh conviction. Thursday’s close, therefore, reflects not just a reaction to a single trigger but a broader reassessment of risk in an uncertain global environment.

**Source**: AOL | **Date**: 2026-02-19T22:17:00+00:00

> Investors and the White House may be betting on multiple interest-rate cuts this year, but the Federal Reserve just delivered a warning: The next move could be up, not down.
> Minutes of the January Federal Open Market Committee released Feb. 18 show several Fed officials discussed the possibility of raising interest rates if sticky inflation remains above the Fed’s 2% target.
> That’s right: a resumption of interest-rate hikes if the nation’s labor market continues to stabilize but inflation persists.
> “Several participants indicated that they would have supported a two-sided description of the committee’s future interest-rate decisions, reflecting the possibility that upward adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate could be appropriate if inflation remains at above-target levels,” the minutes said.
> Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, told CNBC after the FOMC minutes were released that she “wouldn’t rule out” rising inflation.
> “There is a risk inflation could tick up,’’ she said, adding that Schwab has moved its forecast of a second rate cut to later in 2026.
> The FOMC voted 10-2 to hold interest rates steady at 3.50% to 3.75% in January on the benchmark Federal Funds Rate after three continuous cuts of 25 basis points in its last three meetings of 2025.
> The Federal Funds Rate guides interest rates for investors and consumers on auto and student loans, home-equity loans and credit cards.
> For consumers, a delayed rate cut could mean higher borrowing costs that remain in place longer than expected.
> President Donald Trump and other White House officials have repeatedly demanded that the independent central bank slash rates to as low as 1% immediately.
> Fed Governors Stephen Miran and Christopher Waller dissented on the January pause, saying they would have preferred a 25-basis-point cut due to softening in the labor market.
> It was the FOMC’s first pause since July 2025.
> Related: Kevin Warsh’s net worth: The Trump Fed nominee’s wealth & income
> The Fed’s dual congressional mandate requires it to balance inflation and job growth via interest rates.
> Lower interest rates support hiring but can fuel inflation.
> Higher rates cool prices but can weaken the job market.
> The two goals often conflict, operate on different timelines and are influenced by unpredictable global events.
> Fed Chair Powell sends frustrating message on future interest-rate cuts
> After the December rate cut, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that the lowering of rates brought monetary policy “within a broad range of neutral.”
> A neutral rate neither stimulates nor restrains economic growth.
> Following the January meeting, Powell described the U.S. economy as “resilient” and said the Fed was well positioned to consider future changes in monetary policy.
> “The economy has once again surprised us with its strength, not for the first time,” Powell said.
> The Fed last paused interest rates in September 2023, holding the funds rate at 5.25% to 5.50% after a rapid tightening cycle aimed at curbing post-pandemic inflation.
> The pause lasted nearly a year as policymakers wanted to see whether higher borrowing costs would tame inflation without tipping the economy into a recession.
> During that pause, inflation gradually cooled and the labor market remained resilient.
> The central bank resumed cutting rates in September 2025 once Fed officials became confident that inflation was moving sustainably toward the Fed’s 2% target.
> The FOMC minutes do not name the participants. But a “vast majority” judged that employment risks have eased, leaving inflation and tariff implications to the growing concern of the central bank.
> Additional policy actions will be considered on a “month-by-month” basis, the minutes said, underscoring that the next move is not guaranteed to be an interest-rate cut.
> But there is a possibility of further easing.
> “In considering the outlook for monetary policy, several participants commented that further downward adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate would likely be appropriate if inflation were to decline in line with their expectations,” the minutes said.
> The Fed is cautious about cutting rates too quickly out of concern it may be sending the wrong signal about its commitment to its 2% target.
> Simultaneously, policymakers don’t want to damage the labor market which showed significant signs of cooling late last year.
> Inflation and employment data published since the Fed’s January meeting show accelerating growth, slowing inflation and a stabilizing labor market.
> Overall inflation unexpectedly dropped to 2.4% in January from the same time last year. That was down from the previous 2.7% annual pace.
> Core inflation, which filters out volatile food and energy prices, ticked down to 2.5% on a year-over-year basis. It last stood at 2.6%.
> The Fed’s preferred inflation gauge -- Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) -- will be released Feb. 20.
> Related: Fed official signals surprise rate-cut shift
> Since the Consumer Price Index rose less than expected last month, it may have addressed concerns of some Fed policymakers that inflation may be too high to cut interest rates more than once this year, especially after the hot January jobs report was much stronger than expected.
> The January jobs report on Feb. 11 delivered a sharp upside surprise, complicating expectations for Fed interest-rate cuts and reinforcing the view that the U.S. labor market remains more resilient than policymakers anticipated.
> Payrolls rose by the most in more than a year to 130,000, beating estimates of 55,000.
> Theunemployment rate unexpectedly fell to 4.3% from 4.4%.
> At the January meeting, participants debated whether their focus should be on supporting the labor market or on bringing inflation closer to its 2% target.
> “Some participants commented that it would likely be appropriate to hold the policy rate steady for some time as the Committee carefully assesses incoming data, and a number of these participants judged that additional policy easing may not be warranted until there was clear indication that the progress of disinflation was firmly back on track,” the minutes said.
> Since that January meeting, several Fed policymakers have maintained that an overall stable economy provides sufficient reasons to be patient before creating further interest-rate actions.
> They include Fed Governor Lisa Cook, Dallas Federal Reserve President Lorie Logan and Cleveland Federal Reserve President Beth Hammack.
> “We feel the costs of elevated inflation with every shopping trip. The longer that inflation remains at these levels, the greater the risk that it becomes entrenched in the economy,’’ Hammock said.
> In short, economists and market strategists broadly emphasized caution from the FOMC, saying the minutes indicate rate cuts are not imminent and that persistent inflation could even resurrect the case for future rate hikes.
> There is still a month of economic data, including the February jobs, CPI, and CPE reports, to be released before the March FOMC meeting.

> DT Midstream (NYSE: DTM) is an owner, operator and developer of natural gas interstate and intrastate pipelines, storage and gathering systems, compression, treatment and surface facilities. The company transports clean natural gas for utilities, power plants, marketers, large industrial customers and energy producers across the Southern, Northeastern and Midwestern United States and Canada. The Detroit-based company offers a comprehensive, wellhead-to-market array of services, including natural gas transportation, storage and gathering.

> Why DT Midstream Uses Operating Earnings, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow
> Use of Operating Earnings Information – Operating Earnings exclude non-recurring items, certain mark-to-market adjustments and discontinued operations. DT Midstream management believes that Operating Earnings provide a more meaningful representation of the company’s earnings from ongoing operations and uses Operating Earnings as the primary performance measurement for external communications with analysts and investors. Internally, DT Midstream uses Operating Earnings to measure performance against budget and to report to the Board of Directors.
> Adjusted EBITDA is defined as GAAP net income attributable to DT Midstream before expenses for interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and loss from financing activities, further adjusted to include the proportional share of net income from equity method investees (excluding interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), and to exclude certain items the company considers non-routine. DT Midstream believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful to the company and external users of DT Midstream’s financial statements in understanding operating results and the ongoing performance of the underlying business because it allows management and investors to have a better understanding of actual operating performance unaffected by the impact of interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and non-routine charges noted in the table below. We believe the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is meaningful to investors because it is frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in the midstream industry to evaluate a company’s operating performance without regard to items excluded from the calculation of such measure, which can vary substantially from company to company depending on accounting methods, book value of assets, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired, among other factors. DT Midstream uses Adjusted EBITDA to assess the company’s performance by reportable segment and as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting.
> Distributable Cash Flow (DCF) is calculated by deducting earnings from equity method investees, depreciation and amortization attributable to noncontrolling interests, cash interest expense, maintenance capital investment (as defined below), and cash taxes from, and adding interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, certain items we consider non-routine and dividends and distributions from equity method investees to, Net Income Attributable to DT Midstream. Maintenance capital investment is defined as the total capital expenditures used to maintain or preserve assets or fulfill contractual obligations that do not generate incremental earnings. We believe DCF is a meaningful performance measurement because it is useful to us and external users of our financial statements in estimating the ability of our assets to generate cash earnings after servicing our debt, paying cash taxes and making maintenance capital investments, which could be used for discretionary purposes such as common stock dividends, retirement of debt or expansion capital expenditures.
> In this release, DT Midstream provides 2026 and 2027 Adjusted EBITDA guidance. The reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA as projected for full-year 2026 and 2027 is not provided. DT Midstream does not forecast net income as it cannot, without unreasonable efforts, estimate or predict with certainty the components of net income. These components, net of tax, may include, but are not limited to, impairments of assets and other charges, divestiture costs, acquisition costs, or changes in accounting principles. All of these components could significantly impact such financial measures. At this time, DT Midstream is not able to estimate the aggregate impact, if any, of these items on future period reported earnings. Accordingly, DT Midstream is not able to provide a corresponding GAAP equivalent for Adjusted EBITDA.

### 3. [Overheating American economy may derail our recovery](https://www.interest.co.nz/rural-news/137283/allan-barber-warns-livestock-farmers-be-ready-both-trade-and-economic-shock-when)
**Source**: interest.co.nz | **Date**: 2026-02-19T03:41:00+00:00

> The UK Telegraph’s International Business Editor, Ambrose Evans Pritchard, assesses the American economy to be at risk of a massive bubble by the end of this year, writing “all the levers of economic stimulus are pushed to the maximum which sets the conditions for torrid overheating and an unstable boom. “
> The factors influencing this are bank deregulation, credit expansion, lower interest rates, a weakening US dollar and quantitative easing, further exacerbated by Trump’s US$2000 tariff dividend to each American before the mid-term elections.
> As Pritchard says, this is either a courageous experiment in running the economy hot or an insane mix of the worst policies since the 1970s, when my namesake Anthony Barber who was UK Chancellor of the Exchequer engineered a huge boom with corporate tax cuts. The boom lasted 18 months to be followed by a horrendous bout of ‘stagflation’ or runaway inflation without growth, the worst of all worlds.
> On a much smaller scale this scenario bears a strong similarity to the decisions of the Labour/NZ First coalition in 2020 to encourage lower interest rates, a loosening of credit restrictions and printing money by the Reserve Bank, otherwise known as quantitative easing. To be fair these decisions were driven by a desire to save businesses and jobs threatened by the pandemic. But these conditions went on far too long.
> But it is hard to argue with the result over the last four years: stubborn inflation and minimal growth, an economic state of affairs that appears perilously close to ‘stagflation.’  An enquiry into the Reserve Bank is totally justified by New Zealand’s mediocre performance since Covid, although delaying it for nearly three years seems bizarre.
> A prompt enquiry in 2024 may well have been more beneficial to the present government than leaving it so close to the next election. By then the public’s ability to link the Reserve Bank’s, and by implication the Labour/NZ First coalition’s, actions and decision making to the state of the economy will have faded. The healthy position of both those parties in the opinion polls suggests the public is no longer interested in blaming them for the recession which is incredible, considering the damage their policies wrought.
> Meanwhile the agriculture sector continues to bolster New Zealand’s export earnings. MPI’s Situation and Outlook Report forecasts growth in exports of all commodities except seafood for 2025/26. The forecast is for a 3% increase in value to $62 billion with greater volumes of dairy, forestry and horticultural products and higher value of meat exports.
> The dairy price was forecast to fall because of higher volumes chasing lower demand but the latest online auctions farmer have posted an increase after several lower results. Time will tell how sustainable this uptick proves to be.
> In calendar year 2025 meat exports rose 19% to $11.7 billion and are expected to reach $13.2 billion for the June year, based on higher demand from all the main markets. The United States took 17% more product, up to $3.2 billion despite the tariffs, while China was relatively flat at $2.5 billion, followed by the EU, 42% higher at $1.8 billion. Exports to the UK went up 64% and Canada 52%.
> In total the five main markets bought $9 billion, equivalent to more than three quarters of all exports. There were some standout performances within these markets – the value of beef sales to the UK rose by 378% which is entirely attributable to the NZ/UK FTA, while sales of frozen sheepmeat to Saudi Arabia almost reached $100 million. Lamb sales to the EU, the most valuable market, rose by 50% mainly because of a shortage of domestic lamb which was 3.4% lower than the previous year.
> The unpredictability of global affairs makes it almost impossible to predict what will happen beyond later this year, but if the US economy continues at its present rate, the New Zealand economy and our exports should perform positively.
> One cloud on the horizon for New Zealand’s American beef exports is Trump’s decision to lift Argentina’s tariff free quota from 20,000 to 100,00 tonnes, specifically to enable supplies of lean beef trimmings to ensure “affordable beef for the American consumer.” This move will cut directly across our most important beef market.
> Furthermore if the dire predictions of an overheated US economy turn out to be correct, we need to brace ourselves for a challenging economic and geopolitical environment. Farmers will hopefully benefit from at least one more year of strong demand but I’m not sure either prospective government will have an easy three year term up to 2029.

> I ask because in my neck of the woods, in continuing sheep and beef operations I'm seeing an uptick in beef numbers and small reductions in breeding ewe numbers. And of course there have been whole farms change land use to forestry - meaning total cattle numbers in the area maybe static but ewe numbers are significantly reduced.
> I "feel" like beef volumes have been lower in recent years, but only based on recent inabilities to find calves for myself. But on the flip side id say given beef prices, stock units should increase substantially.
> All of agriculture is fairly wibbly wobbly, supply and demand bounce all over the place due to so many variables.

### 5. [Dovish RBNZ holds OCR and says 'monetary policy is likely to remain accommodative for some time'](https://www.interest.co.nz/economy/137177/reserve-bank-has-held-official-cash-rate-225-and-not-forecasting-rise-until-either)
**Source**: interest.co.nz | **Date**: 2026-02-19T11:34:00+00:00

> The Reserve Bank (RBNZ) has left the Official Cash Rate (OCR) unchanged at 2.25% as expected, but perhaps less expectedly has taken a 'dovish' view of the future.
> In her first OCR decision, Governor Anna Breman expressed confidence inflation would return to the RBNZ's explicit target level of 2% over the next 12 months. And the feared rises in the OCR are not being forecast to happen at this stage - not by the RBNZ anyway. Nor are house price rises - the RBNZ now expects 0.0% movement in house prices in the 2026 calendar year.
> The kiwi dollar and wholesale interest rates dropped slightly immediately after the OCR announcement.
> And in the record of the meeting of the RBNZ Monetary Policy Committee, the committee said that if the economy evolves as expected, monetary policy "is likely to remain accommodative for some time".
> "The committee will continue to assess incoming data carefully. As the recovery strengthens and inflation falls sustainably towards the target midpoint, monetary policy settings will gradually normalise."
> The committee thought that monetary policy needed to remain accommodative to support a sustained recovery in economic activity.
> "There is a risk that prolonged caution on the part of households could slow the recovery in consumption activity, particularly in the context of a recent tightening in financial conditions. Members also noted global risks that could slow domestic economic recovery. Significant excess capacity, modest wage growth, and core inflation within the target band provides confidence that inflation will return to the midpoint of the target band."
> Breman said risks to the inflation outlook "are balanced".
> "The global environment remains highly uncertain. Domestically, greater caution by households in their spending decisions could slow the pace of New Zealand’s economic recovery, risking inflation falling below the target midpoint. But with demand increasing in the economy, businesses could try to increase prices faster than expected, leaving inflation above the target midpoint."
> Ahead of Wednesday's decision, financial markets were pricing in a more than two-thirds chance that the first rise in the OCR would come in September of this year.
> As ever then, the new set of OCR projections contained in the February Monetary Policy Statement  (MPS), also released on Wednesday, will be pored over by economists and market watchers.
> In the last MPS, issued in November, the RBNZ incorporated about a 20% chance of another cut to the OCR early this year. The first rise in the OCR was not projected to happen, probably, till the second quarter of NEXT year.
> 'OCR to rise gradually, as necessary'
> In the forecasts contained in the new February MPS (page 40) the RBNZ is suggesting there may be a rise in the OCR either late this year or in the first quarter of next year. But contrary to some expectations, there's not much forecast to follow.
> The rate track contained in the forecasts suggests only three potential rate hikes in the forecast period through to 2029.
> In the February MPS, the RBNZ says that "conditional on the central economic outlook", it projects that the OCR will remain around its current level in the near term, before gradually increasing from late 2026.
> "We assume price‑setting behaviour will continue to adapt to a low‑inflation environment, easing inflationary pressure. We also expect that past reductions in the OCR will support an ongoing recovery in domestic activity and a reduction in spare capacity over time. As the economy recovers, the MPC expects to increase the OCR gradually as necessary to contain inflationary pressure and ensure that inflation settles sustainably near the target mid‑point."
> The backdrop to the first OCR decision of 2026, is that following clear indications from the RBNZ after the last OCR decision (a 25 point cut) in November, wholesale interest rates rose, leading in short order to banks starting to increase mortgage rates again.
> There's been rising concern about inflation and recent developments have not helped. The annual inflation rate as measured by the Consumers Price Index (CPI) rose in the December quarter to 3.1%, putting it outside the RBNZ's 1% to 3% target range.
> On Tuesday, release of the January Selected Price Indexes, showed that food prices shot up 2.5% in January - the largest monthly rise in four years. Three surveys the RBNZ conducts that examine future expected inflation have all been released in the past week - and have generally shown expectations of future inflation rising, which is a warning signal because inflation expectations feed into pricing behaviour, IE they cause more inflation.
> Wednesday's announcement by the RBNZ would appear to be very much a push-back at the rises in market pricing that followed the last OCR announcement in 2025.
> House prices forecast to be completely flat this year
> In the forecasts contained in the MPS the RBNZ is now forecasting that house prices won't move at all this year. In the MPS in November, the RBNZ forecast that there would be a 3.8% rise in the 2026 calendar year, but now the forecast is for 0.0%.
> The RBNZ forecasts that house prices will rise a modest 3.0% next year and then 4.6% in 2028.
> This is the statement from the Reserve Bank:
> Annual consumers price inflation was slightly above the Monetary Policy Committee’s 1 to 3 percent target band at the end of 2025. Increases in food and electricity prices and local council rates were the biggest contributors to above-target inflation.
> The economy is at an early stage in its recovery. With ongoing strength in commodity prices, economic activity in the agricultural sector and regional New Zealand remains strong. Although residential and business investment is increasing, households remain cautious in their spending. The labour market is stabilising, but unemployment remains elevated. House price growth remains weak, dampening household wealth and inclination to spend.
> In response to previous cuts in the OCR, economic growth is broadening across sectors of the economy, such as manufacturing, construction and some retail. Economic growth is expected to increase over 2026.
> Inflation is most likely returning to within the Committee’s 1 to 3 percent target band in the current quarter. The Committee is confident that inflation will fall to the 2 percent midpoint over the next 12 months due to spare capacity in the economy, modest wage growth, and core inflation within the target band.
> Risks to the inflation outlook are balanced. The global environment remains highly uncertain. Domestically, greater caution by households in their spending decisions could slow the pace of New Zealand’s economic recovery, risking inflation falling below the target midpoint. But with demand increasing in the economy, businesses could try to increase prices faster than expected, leaving inflation above the target midpoint.
> The Committee agreed to hold the OCR at 2.25 percent. If the economy evolves as expected, monetary policy is likely to remain accommodative for some time. The Committee will continue to assess incoming data carefully. As the recovery strengthens and inflation falls sustainably towards the target midpoint, monetary policy settings will gradually normalise.
> Summary of Monetary Policy Committee meeting:
> A significant easing in monetary policy since August 2024 is supporting a recovery in economic activity. Annual consumers price inflation increased to 3.1 percent in the December 2025 quarter, slightly above the Monetary Policy Committee’s 1 to 3 percent target range. The Committee is confident, however, that with significant excess capacity in the economy, inflation will fall to around the mid-point of the target range over the next 12 months.
> Headline inflation is expected to fall to near the mid-point of the target band
> The Committee noted that headline inflation is most likely returning to the target band in the March 2026 quarter. Recent increases in inflation have been driven by higher tradables inflation, partly due to larger increases in volatile items such as food, international airfares, and overseas accommodation. Tradables inflation is expected to fall back over the next 12 months due to relatively stable import prices and some support from the recent appreciation in the New Zealand dollar.
> Inflation has also been held up by some components of non-tradables inflation that are less sensitive to monetary policy, particularly administered prices. These are prices that are set or heavily influenced by central or local government. Inflation in these components has been due to a lagged response to previous high inflation and a range of structural factors. The Committee expects there to be less inflation in some administered prices over the coming year, such as electricity lines fees, university fees and vehicle licensing fees.
> Components of the non-tradables basket that are sensitive to monetary policy have declined to around historic average levels. Measures of core inflation have remained stable, albeit mostly above the target midpoint. Rates of wage inflation remain consistent with inflation trending back towards 2 percent.
> The Committee emphasised the importance that higher near-term inflation not become embedded in longer-run expectations. Inflation expectations for professional forecasters and business leaders increased slightly across all tenors, but long-term expectations remain close to the target mid-point. Inflation expectations of households have continued to decline from elevated levels.
> Significant spare capacity remains
> The Committee noted that there is still significant spare capacity in the economy. The output gap is estimated to be -1.5 percent of potential GDP in the December 2025 quarter.
> Spare capacity in the labour market is substantial but stabilising. While the unemployment rate increased to 5.4 percent, key measures of employment strengthened over the December quarter. The labour market is expected to continue to strengthen as the nascent recovery in economic activity broadens through 2026.
> Continued spare capacity, subdued wage growth and measures of core inflation within the target band provide the Committee with confidence that the conditions are in place to return and sustain inflation at 2 percent over the medium term.
> Economic activity is now recovering
> Economic activity began recovering over the second half of last year in response to strong export prices and supportive monetary policy settings. GDP increased by 1.1 percent in the September quarter, after falling 1.0 percent in the June quarter. The Committee noted that measured GDP data has been more volatile than usual, in part due to a range of temporary factors and measurement issues.
> There are signs that the recovery is broadening across the economy, although the September quarter GDP likely overstates the true level of momentum in the economy. Residential and business investment both increased from low levels, and measures of investment intentions and building consent issuance have all increased. More timely measures of economic activity such as the QSBO, PMI, and PSI suggest that growth has been maintained in 2025Q4 and 2026Q1.
> The economic recovery has been uneven across sectors and regions. Stronger activity has been observed in the rural economy and in the primary sector. Consumer spending has been constrained by low growth in employment income and the negative effect of falling real house prices on household wealth.
> House prices have continued to edge downwards despite lower mortgage rates and a modest pick-up in housing market activity. This possibly reflects weak population growth and elevated long-term interest rates. House price growth is expected to gradually increase over 2026 and then grow at around the rate of household income growth over the medium term.
> Household consumption is projected to increase over the medium term as past reductions in the Official Cash Rate (OCR) continue to support demand. The Committee noted that labour market conditions are likely to become more important relative to house prices in influencing consumption.
> Government expenditure is assumed to grow at a subdued pace over the medium term, consistent with the Half Year Economic and Fiscal Update 2025 projections.
> Domestic financial conditions have tightened since November
> The New Zealand dollar Trade Weighted Index has appreciated, reflecting higher domestic interest rates and a weakening US dollar. Wholesale interest rates beyond 12 months have increased due to higher global interest rates and investor expectations of future increases in the OCR. Banks have passed these increases through to fixed-term mortgage rates.
> The flow of mortgage borrowing priced in the 1–2-year terms increased substantially since November. While the average mortgage rate has declined to 5.1 percent, further downward adjustments are expected to be less than assumed in November.
> Global growth has been resilient but risks remain high
> The Committee noted that the global economy was more resilient than expected in 2025. Tariffs have had less impact on global growth than previously expected, while strong investment in artificial intelligence technology has supported exports from our trading partners in Asia. Expansionary fiscal policy has also supported growth in a number of economies. The Committee continues to expect trade barriers to present a headwind to growth, with trading partner growth expected to weaken slightly over 2026.
> On a trade weighted basis, global inflation has declined, but there has been significant divergence across countries. Tariff policies have increased inflation pressure in some economies such as the US, but these have been offset by disinflationary pressure in China and the broader Asia region.
> Geopolitical developments over recent months have led to continued high economic uncertainty and financial market volatility. The US dollar has declined, while the prices of oil and precious metals have risen, along with sovereign bond term premia.
> The domestic financial system remains stable
> The Committee was briefed on financial system stability. Measures of domestic financial stress have eased as lower interest rates reduce debt servicing pressures. Non-performing housing loans have also declined, and banks expect further reductions in housing and commercial property impairments over 2026. The Committee agreed that there is currently no material trade-off between meeting its inflation objectives and maintaining financial system stability.
> Risks to the outlook for inflation are balanced
> There are upside and downside risks to the near-term outlook for inflation. The Committee noted the contribution that administered price inflation had played in recent inflation outturns and the risk that this could remain high for longer than currently assumed. Conversely, the Committee discussed the risk that volatile components of tradable inflation could fall more rapidly.
> The Committee discussed the risks around firms’ price-setting behaviour. While weak demand has constrained the ability of firms to pass on higher costs, the Committee noted the risk that changing price setting behaviour could result in higher inflation. In this context the Committee also discussed the risk that the output gap could be smaller than currently estimated, accentuating the risk that firms raise prices as demand improves. This could lead to more persistence in domestically generated inflation pressure that would require tighter monetary policy than otherwise.
> Members noted risks regarding the speed of the economic recovery. The Committee noted the risk that household spending could be slower to recover than currently assumed, particularly if house price growth remains subdued. This could lead to households continuing to maintain higher levels of precautionary saving. Conversely members noted a risk that higher export incomes and the return of capital to dairy farmers from the sale of Fonterra’s consumer brands business could spur higher investment and consumer spending by farmers.
> The global outlook is uncertain
> The Committee noted that the global economic outlook continues to be highly uncertain. In the near-term, key uncertainties relate to the direction of global trade policy, market valuations of artificial intelligence investment and geopolitical tensions. Downside risks remain to growth in China as policy makers attempt to maintain growth targets in the face of weak domestic demand. Continued excess capacity and subdued demand in China could create greater disinflationary pressure.
> Over the longer term, the Committee noted risks associated with unsustainable fiscal dynamics in several countries. This could put ongoing pressure on central bank independence and create conditions for more persistent global inflation. This could lead to higher long-term global real interest rates and create risks to global financial stability.
> The Committee reached consensus to hold the OCR at 2.25 percent
> The Committee discussed the monetary conditions required to achieve their medium-term inflation mandate.
> The Committee agreed that the economic recovery remains nascent, and a premature normalisation of monetary conditions could dampen the recovery and lead inflation to undershoot the target. The Committee also considered the risk that policy remains accommodative for too long, leading inflation to persist above the mid-point of the target range for longer.
> Members agreed that the monetary policy stance would need to remain accommodative for some time to support a sustained recovery in economic activity. There is a risk that prolonged caution on the part of households could slow the recovery in consumption activity, particularly in the context of a recent tightening in financial conditions. Members also noted global risks that could slow domestic economic recovery. Significant excess capacity, modest wage growth and core inflation within the target band provides confidence that inflation will return to the midpoint of the target band.
> Members noted the risk of inflation remaining more persistent, given surveys showing somewhat elevated inflation expectations and business pricing intentions. One member supported maintaining the OCR at current levels for now but noted that if economic activity recovers as expected, monetary stimulus could begin to be withdrawn somewhat earlier without compromising the economic recovery. Another member noted that responding too quickly to firms’ pricing intentions could reinforce perceptions of strong demand and encourage firms to align on further price increases.
> On Wednesday 18 February the Committee reached consensus to hold the OCR at 2.25 percent. The forward OCR path reflects a somewhat stronger economic outlook and balanced risks to inflation.
> If the economy evolves as expected, monetary policy is likely to remain accommodative for some time. The Committee will continue to assess incoming data carefully. As the recovery strengthens and inflation falls sustainably towards the target midpoint, monetary policy settings will gradually normalise.

> I still think we should be at 2.00% before pausing but that would cause the market to have a hissy fit since they took it upon themselves to start hiking before anything substantial had changed.
> It's a bit of a ho-hum word salad isn't it, however the take is that they do not feel it necessary to make changes, and don't like to say too much knowing it will have broader implications of impacting decisions people and businesses will make. A more restrained statement if you will, which is refreshing IMO.
> I wonder if no communication would work better. “We have decided to leave the OCR at 2.25%. Nothing else, see you next time”.
> Now now Jim, Anna has just taken the helm, and has to be seen to be doing something, not least for the country but at minimum for showing face and building her image in the public eye.
> Market doesn't like being wrong-footed, it's expensive.
> Wow... election year pressure I guess. With the current inflation and now more to come as businesses adjust to staff pressure would have seen an increase was a sure thing.
> Not sure I get your logic. I'd have thought the pressure from govt would be to lower to increase borrowing and the housing market, claiming a win for the economy come election time. I'm sure Anna is well aware of the historical image of the RBNZ under Orr and will manage this accordingly.
> He simply wants investors with a mortgage to burn in hell.
> Of course, but given he has the opposite view from my own, the rationale was what was being queried. Still waiting on that one.
> I don’t think the RBNZ are under the same political pressures as the Fed. Despite Orr’s faults, he was strong minded and would have certainly spoken out if it was the case.
> correct he left over the amount of capital he felt banks should hold.....
> What you want to happen and what actually happens are two different things Averageman.
> On Tuesday, release of the January Selected Price Indexes, showed that food prices shot up 2.5% in January - the largest monthly rise in four years.
> I've been getting a bit of pushback at the water cooler about my perception of food prices and how it's indicative of cost pressures across the supply chains. Now, forget about the arguments that monetary inflation pushes business costs up across the board for a minute. To meet sales and revenue targets, you can either
> 1. Cut margins and sell more vol
> 2. Increase shelf prices and hope to maintain sales vol - working on consumer willingness to pay
> As I've said ad nauseum, it's the nice to haves and the deli foods that feel the heat first. If carrot and turnip prices are up 2.5%, most people don't notice.
> Have a look at the reduction in selection...what does that tell you?
> That became noticeable since 2021-2022 with shipping delays. Followed by poor performing NZD IMO at least
> That Paul Conway bloke needs to bin the grey shirt and put on a tie. Dress for success mate!
> Nice guy and intelligent. There are no expectations that he dresses like Tony Montana and has the delivery of a motivational speaker at a real estate seminar.
> Anyway, adopting a 'hip' persona did little for Lord Orr in the end.
> A few lines of coke might help put some color in his face!
> As for Orr he looked like an overgrown schoolboy squeezed into a hideous off the rack Hallensteins suit!
> sadly , on the second point, I find myself agreeing with you a second time, what is the world coming too.
> "Say hello to my little friend!"
> Loving it, I wonder what the OCR bulls desperate to see the OCR rise like Average man Gecko think now.
> I honestly find their rate-hike hysteria entertaining :-)
> Breman's "laser focus on inflation" is out the window already 😂 That really didn't take long
> Time will tell. It seemed a reasonable decision to me. Everyone seems to think the OCR has to change every time, some as it would help their debt servicing costs, and others who overblow inflation risk. Give it 6-9months and we'll revisit her call.
> Yes one of the many problems with Orr was his off/on the accelerator approach. Using the OCR as a blunt tool. Exacerbated by the fact that changes to the OCR take a while to feed through the economy.
> Too early to judge the new Governor but a steady as she goes approach could be no bad thing after the incompetence of the Orr regime.
> He lost credibility to me and any in 2020 when announcing unprecedented stimulus via FLP and LSAP, knowing full well the level of fiscal stimulus form the govt also (covid payments), and seeing the levels of private credit expanding at rates never seen before, then sitting on his hands knowing full well that there would be a surge in inflation. The correct course would clearly have been to tick up the OCR along with the stimulus to tamper an overreaction by borrowers. I will admit that the addition of the employment mandate can attest to some influence in that space, however not in any way enough to keep the decisions of the RBNZ as credible with him at the helm, and many are paying for it still.
> This all suggests 2026 is not going to be a great year for the economy if the RBNZ is expecting inflation to cool down based on their forecast for weak demand. Inflation is now above the target upper band of 3.0% and the RBNZ has a single mandate since 2024 - that mandate is inflation. Not unemployment or business confidence - inflation.
> Maintaining an accommodative stance on the OCR pre-supposes that other economic forces will bring inflation back into band.
> The ship is headed in the right direction. Steady as she goes.  Let her do her job, stop telling her what you think she
> should not be doing. Too many cooks spoil the broth.  Let NZ live a little
> And in the record of the meeting of the RBNZ Monetary Policy Committee, the committee said that if the economy evolves as expected, monetary policy "is likely to remain accommodative for some time".
> The economy is crap, and we think it will be for a while
> To which the Government will say
> We are solving the cost of living crisis, by saving $xxx per week through reduced interest rates.
> In past cycles lower rates have caused higher house prices = feel good fact = increased consumer spending
> this time not so much and the RBNZ are therefore a bit stumped as they want the economy to pick up a bit, noting that they think this feel good , will come this time, from labour market , lower unemployment and wage increase, hell may freeze over first.
> economic recovery is a 2027 story and now luxy is worried
> My pick is they are looking for a slow build and tempered increase in spending, not a sugar hit like 2021.
> 0.0% feels like hedging their bets, but do we think would they ever publicly forecast a decrease?
> Well, I'm gobsmacked. I thought she would follow the market up.
> Imo the following quotation is the key message
> 'Over the longer term, the Committee noted risks associated with unsustainable fiscal dynamics in several countries. This could put ongoing pressure on central bank independence and create conditions for more persistent global inflation. This could lead to higher long-term global real interest rates and create risks to global financial stability'.
> Not that NZ can do much about 'unsustainable fiscal dynamics in several countries' except avoid more debt where possible, diversify, increase the range of income streams, export more, import less, become more efficient, raise productivity, increase investment in R&D, support international systems up holding the rule of law and fair trade in open markets, and broaden our cultural and trading relationships with the world.
