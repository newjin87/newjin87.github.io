### 1. [Trump Oversells Recent U.S. Economic Growth](https://www.factcheck.org/2026/02/trump-oversells-recent-u-s-economic-growth/)

> In the second and third quarters of 2025, the U.S. economy grew at its fastest pace in two years. Those growth rates were not “numbers unheard of,” or figures the U.S. “never had” before, as President Donald Trump has claimed.
> In addition, economic experts told us that federal data do not support Trump’s claim that there was economic “stagflation” during the Biden administration and “the complete opposite” during Trump’s first year back in office. Inflation was high during much of Joe Biden’s presidency, but economic growth was not stagnant, another key indicator of stagflation, the experts said.
> They also said that Trump’s tariff policies likely hindered economic growth, rather than helped spur it, as the president has suggested.
> Trump made those claims while touting the U.S. economy in recent speeches and remarks, as well as in a late January opinion piece written for the Wall Street Journal.
> During a Jan. 27 speech in Iowa, Trump said, “So, under my leadership, economic growth is exploding to numbers unheard of. They’ve never had them before.”
> He later said in an interview with NBC News on Feb. 4, “We have low inflation and we have tremendous growth. You haven’t had these numbers like this.”
> And when claiming to have achieved “unprecedented” growth numbers in a Jan. 29 Cabinet meeting at the White House, Trump said that if not for the 43-day federal government shutdown last fall, “we would have picked up about a point and a half more than [the] already high numbers, record setting numbers.”
> While the U.S. economy grew significantly in the second and third quarters of 2025, according to the most recent data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the numbers did not set records, as Trump claimed.
> After declining by an annualized rate of 0.6% in the first quarter of 2025, which covers the three months from January to March, real gross domestic product (meaning it has been adjusted for inflation) grew at an annualized rate of 3.8% in the second quarter of 2025 and at a rate of 4.4% in the third quarter. Those were the largest quarterly increases since the third quarter of 2023, under Biden, when the economy expanded at an annualized rate of 4.7%, according to BEA estimates.
> The record for quarterly growth is 34.9% in the third quarter of 2020, which happened right after the economy shrunk by 28% at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pre-pandemic quarterly growth record is 16.7% in the first quarter of 1950, according to BEA quarterly data going back to 1947.
> On several occasions, Trump has said that fourth quarter growth is projected to be 5.4%, a figure that he has attributed to the Federal Reserve Bank in Atlanta. But that projection is now out of date.
> Throughout much of January, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s GDPNow model was projecting growth of 5.4% for the fourth quarter of 2025. Then, on Jan. 29, the projection lowered to 4.2%, and, as of Feb. 10, it was down again, to 3.7% projected growth.
> The BEA is scheduled to release its advanced estimate of GDP for the fourth quarter, and all of 2025, on Feb. 20.
> Trump also has claimed that he turned around an economy that had stalled under Biden.
> “Under the Biden administration, America was plagued by the nightmare of stagflation, meaning low growth and high inflation, a recipe for misery, failure and decline. But now, after just one year of my policies, we are witnessing the exact opposite – virtually no inflation and extraordinarily high economic growth,” Trump said at a World Economic Forum meeting on Jan. 21.
> He repeated the “stagflation” claim in his Jan. 30 opinion piece published in the Wall Street Journal.
> But economists told us that the U.S. economy under Biden did not experience stagflation, which has a specific economic meaning.
> “It refers to a sustained period of high inflation combined with weak or stagnant real economic growth, typically alongside rising unemployment,” Kyle Handley, a professor of economics at the University of California, San Diego, told us in an email. “By that definition, the U.S. economy during the Biden years does not qualify as stagflation.”
> Handley said that the annual inflation rate did “rise sharply” during Biden’s first two years in office. It peaked in June 2022, at 9.1%, before declining dramatically in Biden’s last two years in office.
> “However, real GDP growth during the Biden presidency was positive and often above trend, and unemployment remained historically low,” Handley said. “Real GDP grew strongly in 2021 during the post-pandemic recovery, slowed in 2022 as monetary policy tightened, and then re-accelerated in 2023 and 2024. That is not a period of economic stagnation.”
> In an infographic from November, the staff of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland wrote that the “last major case” of stagflation in the U.S. “occurred in the mid-1970s, when global crude oil prices surged, triggering widespread rises in other prices and fueling inflation of more than 12 percent and unemployment that peaked at 9 percent.” The infographic said that stagflation — the combination of rising unemployment and inflation, and slowing economic growth all at the same time — was “rare” and “an unusual pattern.”
> When we asked about the basis for the president’s stagflation claim, a White House spokespeson told us that “[r]eal wages shrank markedly during the Biden presidency, and growth – once you put aside the early bit of Biden admin when Democrat state officials finally started lifting unscientific and draconian lockdowns – was tepid with inflation at 40-year highs.”
> There was a decrease in real wages under Biden, as we’ve written. But the economy grew by well over 2% each year during his administration, and the rate of inflation, while still elevated, was not near a 40-year high when he left office. The 9.1% annual rate in June 2022 was the highest since November 1981. The rate was 3% in Biden’s final 12 months.
> The unemployment rate also decreased under Biden, going from 6.4% when he was inaugurated to 4% in his last month, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The average monthly rate for Biden’s presidency was 4.1%, below the historical average.
> “You had high inflation, yes, but paired with strong growth and a robust labor market,” Aeimit Lakdawala, an associate professor of economics at Wake Forest University, told us in an email. “That’s just not stagflation by any standard definition of the term.”
> He said that Trump’s claim of engineering a complete turnaround from the Biden economy is an overstatement.
> “What we’re really seeing is a continuation of trends that were already well underway before Trump took office in January 2025,” Lakdawala said.
> He noted that the annual inflation rate had cooled to 3% when Trump’s second term started. It had been as low as 2.4% in September 2024.
> “That disinflation happened under Biden, driven largely by the resolution of supply chain issues and Fed monetary policy,” he said, referring to the Federal Reserve. “Under Trump’s second term so far, inflation has averaged about 2.7%. That’s modestly lower, but it’s not a dramatic reversal.”
> Although Trump considers the 2.7% annual inflation rate, as of December, to be “very low” or “virtually no inflation,” it is still above the 2% target set by the Federal Reserve. Prices are still increasing, just at a slightly slower pace than before he became president again.
> As for economic growth, Lakdawala said that the increase in real GDP has “averaged about 2.5% annualized so far under Trump’s second term, which is solid but actually a touch lower than the 2.9% we saw” in Biden’s last two years as president.
> “So characterizing this as ‘extraordinarily high economic growth’ is a stretch,” he said about Trump’s claim. “It’s good growth, roughly in line with where we’ve been.”
> The unemployment rate, meanwhile, was 4.3% in January, slightly higher than when Trump took office.
> In his Wall Street Journal opinion piece, Trump said that the “entire Trump economic agenda deserves credit for this explosion of growth” — but he specifically gave credit for the country’s “economic success” to his tariff policies.
> “We have proven, decisively, that, properly applied, tariffs do not hurt growth — they promote growth and greatness, just as I said all along,” the opinion piece said.
> But the experts we consulted told us that the economy likely grew despite the tariffs, not because of them.
> “Year-over-year real GDP growth over the past year looks similar to the years immediately preceding the new tariffs,” Handley said. “Outside of the pandemic period, growth has been relatively stable across administrations, which makes it difficult to attribute recent performance to tariffs rather than economic momentum.”
> He noted that the tariffs that Trump placed on imported foreign goods last year were not as high as the rates he originally proposed, and that tariff revenue, which did increase significantly in 2025, is still quite small in relation to GDP (about 1% of GDP as of the third quarter of 2025, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis).
> “By construction, a policy of that size cannot plausibly explain an increase in aggregate economic growth,” he said.
> “Crediting tariffs for economic growth gets the causation backwards,” he said. “The economics on this is fairly clear and there is broad consensus among economists: tariffs are essentially a tax on imports that raises costs for domestic consumers and businesses. If anything, they’ve been a modest drag on growth, not a driver of it.”
> He pointed to an analysis done by the Budget Lab at Yale, a nonpartisan research center, that said that in 2025 tariffs slowed real GDP growth by 0.5 percentage points and increased the unemployment rate by 0.3 percentage points. The Budget Lab estimated that tariffs will reduce real GDP growth by 0.4 percentage points in 2026, and said that “[i]n the long run, the US economy is persistently 0.3% smaller, the equivalent of $100 billion annually in 2025 dollars,” because of tariffs.
> “These aren’t catastrophic numbers and the economy is resilient and has absorbed the tariff shock reasonably well,” Lakdawala said. “But they clearly point in the wrong direction for someone trying to credit tariffs with economic success.”
> The pro-business Tax Foundation also said that Trump’s imposed tariffs, if the Supreme Court rules that some of them can remain in effect, “will raise $2.0 trillion in revenue from 2026-2035 on a conventional basis and reduce US GDP by 0.5 percent, all before foreign retaliation” from other countries.
> The White House told us that, under Trump, the “[a]nnualized rate of inflation has been trending in the mid-twos and GDP growth in Q3 surpassed expectations by over a full point, hitting above 4 percent. Largely driven by the investments we are seeing thanks in part to tariffs.”
> But Handley noted that many of the investments touted by Trump are “announcements rather than realized outcomes.”
> “Foreign investment commitments do not directly enter GDP, and they often reflect projects planned years in advance,” he said, adding that some of the pledges made by foreign countries and companies “may never come to fruition.”
> We’ve already written that Trump’s claim that he has brought in about $18 trillion in investments to the U.S. is exaggerated, according to experts and a White House webpage.
> Giacomo Santangelo, a senior lecturer of economics at Fordham University, told us in an interview that consumption is the “largest portion” of GDP, and that people are currently taking on more debt to finance that spending. “That’s what’s driving this economy,” he said.
> Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM, wrote in December that the third-quarter growth was due to “[h]ousehold consumption driven by higher-income consumers and AI-related investment,” which he said “accounted for just under 70% of total growth during the [third] quarter.”
> In its news release about third-quarter growth in 2025, the BEA said, “The increase in real GDP in the third quarter reflected increases in consumer spending, exports, government spending, and investment.” For the second quarter, the BEA said the increase “primarily reflected a decrease in imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, and an increase in consumer spending.”

### 1. [Gold (XAUUSD) & Silver Price Forecast: $5,000 Holds as Silver Nears $82 - Break or Reject?](https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/gold-xauusd-silver-price-forecast-5000-holds-as-silver-nears-82-break-or-reject-1578496)
**Source**: FX Empire | **Date**: 2026-02-11T09:10:00+00:00

> Gold prices are steady between $5,020 and $5,038, holding above the important $5,000 level. Although a more positive market mood has slowed the rally, gold is still in a long-term uptrend.
> The biggest recent change is that Kevin Warsh has been nominated to replace Jerome Powell as Fed Chair, starting in May 2026.
> Hawkish Signal: Markets view Warsh as more hawkish than his predecessor, prioritizing inflation control and a strong US Dollar. This has directly challenged the “endless rate cut” narrative that fueled gold’s rise to $5,600 in January.
> Policy Credibility: Concerns about the Fed’s independence have eased a bit since the nomination, helping to steady the US Dollar. Still, if the Senate hearings hint at political influence over interest rates, it could quickly drive investors to seek safe-haven assets.
> The Chinese Floor: The People’s Bank of China has now bought gold for 15 months in a row as of January 2026. Although they bought less as prices peaked, their move away from the US Dollar is still a key long-term factor for gold.
> Lunar New Year Drain: With Chinese New Year coming up from February 16 to 23, traders expect less buying and selling from Asia. This could make the market less active and more volatile.
> Middle East Thaw: Tensions in the Middle East are easing after talks between the US and Iran in Oman. President Trump called the talks “very good,” which has led investors to shift money from safe assets back into stocks.
> Japan’s Landslide: Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s big win on February 8 has brought in “Sanaenomics,” which means more government spending and higher military budgets.
> This has made investors more willing to take risks and pushed up the Nikkei, so there is less short-term demand for gold. However, worries about Japan’s debt could help gold in the long run.
> Right now, the market is waiting for three important US data releases this week:
> Gold (XAUUSD) is trading near $5,035 on the 2-hour chart, consolidating after bouncing from the $4,680 low. Recent candlesticks are small with short wicks, showing a balanced market. The price remains above the rising trendline from early February, so the recovery is still in place.
> The recent move up has reached a key Fibonacci area. The 38.2% level near $4,855 is acting as support, while the 61.8% retracement around $5,138 is limiting gains. The 50-period moving average is flat near $5,020, and the 100-period average around $4,995 is still supporting the price. RSI is just above 50, showing neutral momentum. If price breaks above $5,138, it could reach $5,318. If not, it may pull back toward $4,995.
> Trade idea: Consider buying if gold dips near $5,000, with a stop below $4,950 and a target of $5,130.
> Silver (XAGUSD) is trading around $81.90 on the 2-hour chart and is testing a downward trendline that has held since the $118 high. Recent candles have small bodies and upper wicks near $82 to $83, which suggests sellers are active on rallies. Overall, the market is still in a corrective phase after the sharp fall to $64.
> The price is staying just above support at $83.90, but it is still below the 50-period moving average at $85.80 and the 100-period average at $92.25, so the outlook stays cautious. Looking at Fibonacci levels, the bounce has paused near the 38.2% retracement of the last drop, which matches up with the trendline resistance.
> The RSI is near 50, showing momentum is balanced and not clearly bullish. If price breaks above $84.00, it could move toward $92.25. If it fails, it might drop back to $75.15.
> Trade idea: Consider selling around $83.50, set a stop above $85.80, and aim for a target of $75.20.

### 2. [Federal Reserve advisor shares forces reshaping auto industry in 2025](https://www.repairerdrivennews.com/2026/02/11/federal-reserve-advisor-shares-forces-reshaping-auto-industry-in-2025/)
**Source**: Repairer Driven News | **Date**: 2026-02-11T10:45:00+00:00

> Kristin Dziczek, a Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago policy advisor, described the 2025 auto industry as a shock absorber during the Automotive Insights Symposium held at the Detroit branch last week
> “Last year, many of us didn’t know what to expect in 2025,” Dziczek said. “We were initially cautiously optimistic, but that quickly faded as the policy environment rapidly changed, and the uncertainty started to rise. Industry leaders put many plans on hold, and they were anticipating some major bumps last year.”
> By the third quarter, the picture became a bit clear, she said. Cautious optimism returned, and planning resumed.
> “It looks like the shock observers held us steady last year, like they’re supposed to,” Dziczek said.
> Tariffs were a defining characteristic of the year, she said.
> “So, we start off the year, January 20, with the America First trade policy memorandum,” Dziczek said. “By March, we had Liberation Day [where] tariffs on nearly every country in the world were announced.”
> The 232 national security tariffs placed 25% on autos in June, she said. Steel and aluminum tariffs also doubled.
> In November, a five-year extension of the import adjustment offset program was made for the auto industry.
> “The administration reached framework deals with the UK, Japan, EU, South Korea; apparently, India now. And that previous 2.5% tariff on imported vehicles jumped to a range of 10% to 15%,” Dziczek said. “We have several pending issues — the national security investigations into robotics and industrial machinery, critical materials, and semiconductors. There’s a possible increase in Korean tariffs, threats on Canada, an outcome of a Supreme Court case on the emergency economic powers that underlie many of those tariffs, and we’re all waiting for more things to happen.”
> More than $200 billion was collected by the government from the tariffs between January and October, she said.
> Auto and auto parts saw total duties paid jump 2.3 times to a peak of 25.7% in July last year, she said. The share dropped back to 18% in October, she said.
> “The stated goals of the American First trade policy were to protect U.S. national security, address unfair and unbalanced trade, promote investment in the U.S., and benefit American workers,” Dziczek said. “So, I want to look at a few of those metrics and whether we can see any movement toward achieving those goals last year.”
> Dziczek said there has been a move back to the U.S. in some cases, including GM’s announcement that they would bring more truck volume to Fort Wayne.
> Overall, the share of U.S. sales built in the U.S. increased in 2025 from 51% to 57%, but that isn’t an abnormal peak, she said. Those sales fluctuate from a low of 51% in May 2020 to 58% in November 2021.
> There was an increase in the share of overall imports that were compliant for U.S.-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) duty-free status, she said.
> “Compliance increased sharply, but the auto tariffs compliance increased as well,” she said. “While sales volume rose about 2.5%, the volume of domestic light vehicle exports fell 20%, and light vehicle imports fell 13%.”
> She said this has not resulted in an investment boom, adding that manufacturing remained flat through 2025.
> There was one plant investment by Rivian in Stanton Springs, Georgia, where ground was broken in September, she said.
> Dziczek said her former employer, the Center for Automotive Research, tracks automotive and supplier investments in North America. She said the data show that automotive and supplier investments vary from year to year.
> In 2023, for example, the United Auto Workers union was in contract negotiations, and multiple investments announced by Detroit’s major automakers, she said.
> “I can guess there’s going to be a similar spike in 2028 when they’re back at the table,” she said.
> For 2024 and 2025, automaker investments were up 2.5%, and supplier investments were down by about 0.5%, she said.
> Total light-vehicle capacity utilization in the industry has been trending downward since Q2 2023, she said.
> U.S. employment trends have also been falling for about two years, she said. Automaker employment has been down 2.5% year-over-year, and suppliers down 3.8%, she said.
> Automaker vehicle production is down 2.6%, and about 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs lost between January and November last year were auto jobs.
> “Did companies become more profitable?” she asked. “Quarterly motor vehicle parts profits were under quite a bit of pressure.”
> Some automakers fared better than others, she said. Many firms took substantial write-offs in the second half of the year tied to federal policy shifts away from EV incentives and other large one-time charges, she said.
> Supplier margins have held steady, remaining within the 6–6.5% range over recent years, she said.
> “But aggregate automaker margins have been cut in half from the 8% range to just 3.9% in quarter three,” Dzcizek said. “Automakers are clearly absorbing the bulk of the recent shocks.”
> Data from a MEMA survey of members found they were significantly more pessimistic about the next 12 months, starting in early 2024. An overall pessimistic opinion peaked in Q1, and the high mark for strong pessimism coincides with the 232 auto tariffs and Liberation Day, she said.
> By Q3 and Q4, pessimism remained high at an overall 47% but settled out, she said. The somewhat and significantly more optimistic responses more than doubled from Q1 at 11% to Q4 at 26%, she said.
> “Many people expect much higher price impacts, bigger shocks to new vehicle prices and even production disruptions stemming from the imposition of such high tariffs,” she said.
> As of October, the average tariff per vehicle has increased 552% year-over-year, but the average transaction price is only up 2.1%, she said.
> “One reason is for the price. Response has been muted as very few countries retaliated against the U.S. for tariff increases,” Dziczek said. “Costs for vehicles produced in global markets were less impacted. It’s also possible that not all of the tariff impacts have been passed on to prices. There are many places where tariffs could have been absorbed or offset.”
> Inventories made before tariffs could have muted the increases, she said. Automakers also may have delayed their price increases while waiting to see what tariffs and exemptions would be once settled.
> After tariffs were settled, automakers then worked to adjust their supply chains by dropping some imported vehicles and scaling back import volumes, she said.
> Some automakers also eliminated some standard features and moved those to paid options. Lease and purchase incentive programs were tweaked, she said.
> “There’s also been a lot of cost-cutting and cost absorption, including spreading U.S. tariff costs across the firm’s Global portfolios,” she said.
> Automakers found some relief in the import adjustment offset program and the relaxation of fuel economy targets, she said.
> “So despite all the tariffs, prices haven’t risen that much,” Dziczek said. “And demand was up in 2025. Still, nominal vehicle prices are north of $50,000, and affordability remains a major concern from consumers, the industry, and federal policymakers.”
> New-vehicle price inflation increased significantly in 2021 and 2022 during the chip crisis, she said.
> “It’s clear that higher prices absolutely crushed car buying sentiment, which has remained depressed since early 2021,” Dziczek said.
> Dziczek said a University of Missouri survey found that higher prices were an indicator of consumers saying it was not a good time to buy.
> New vehicles dipped below the overall inflation rate in 2023, but consumers may still be reacting to those higher price levels, not just lower rates of price increases, she said.
> Used-vehicle prices have remained close to the overall rate of inflation, she said.
> However, other costs for owning a car have increased significantly, she said. This includes vehicle maintenance, repair, and insurance.

### 3. [Crypto Currents: Strategy, Galaxy Digital report Q4 earnings results](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/BITF-Q/pressreleases/89134/crypto-currents-strategy-galaxy-digital-report-q4-earnings-results/)
**Source**: The Globe and Mail | **Date**: 2026-02-11T10:02:00+00:00

> As bitcoin, ethereum and other cryptocurrencies see major legal, institutional, and technological developments, the financial landscape continues to adapt. Stay up on the crypto news that matters with the “Crypto Currents” weekly from The Fly. Also, join us for your essential daily recap, every day at 2 PM ET on FlyCast radio.
> CRYPTO EARNINGS: On Thursday, Strategy (MSTR) reported a fourth quarter loss per share of ($42.93) on revenue of $123M, which compared to a loss per share of ($3.03) for the same period last year and analyst revenue consensus of $118.5M. As of December 31, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $2.3B, as compared to $38.1M as of December 31, 2024.
> “We raised $25.3B of capital in 2025 to advance our Bitcoin treasury strategy, making us the largest equity issuer among U.S. public companies for a second consecutive year. We increased our holdings to 713,502 bitcoins, including 41,002 bitcoins acquired in January 2026 alone. STRC, our flagship Digital Credit instrument, has grown to $3.4B in size, supported by increasing liquidity and declining volatility. Our variable dividend rate mechanism for STRC, currently set at 11.25%, has helped maintain STRC price stability near the $100 stated amount despite a weaker bitcoin price environment. In 2026, we remain focused on expanding STRC to generate amplification and drive growth in Bitcoin Per Share for MSTR common stock investors,” said Phong Le, CEO
> Additionally on Monday, Strategy announced an update on its bitcoin holdings. The company reported acquiring 855 bitcoin for approximately $75.3B at an average purchase price of $87,974 between January 26 and February 1. As of February 1, Strategy holds 713,502 bitcoin acquired for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $54.26B.
> Following earnings, BTIG lowered the firm’s price target on Strategy to $250 from $630 and kept a Buy rating on the shares. The company’s Q4 earnings call was overshadowed by bitcoin prices that traded off 8% in the hours leading up to the call, the analyst said. BTIG reminds investors that Strategy’s convertible debt is “extremely over-collateralized” and is covered even if bitcoin prices drew down 80%. Further, the company has 30 months of USD reserves to cover preferred equity dividend payments, added the firm. It cited the recent bitcoin volatility for the target cut.
> On Tuesday, Galaxy Digital (GLXY) reported a Q4 loss per share of ($1.08) on revenue of $10.37B, which compared to analyst estimates of loss per share of (92c) and revenue of $16.6B. The company reported total equity of $3.04B and holdings of $2.6B in cash and stablecoins as of December 31.
> Following the report, Goldman Sachs lowered the firm’s price target on Galaxy to $24 from $27 and kept a Neutral rating on the shares. Despite the weaker results in the quarter, largely driven by digital assets price depreciation, management remains constructive on the long-term growth trajectory across the Global markets and Asset management businesses, the analyst said. Meanwhile, H.C. Wainwright lowered the firm’s price target on Galaxy to $40 from $45 and kept a Buy rating on the shares. The firm sees an attractive buying opportunity after shares tumbled on weaker-than-expected Q4 results. While the crypto bear market has been a headwind, the potential passage of crypto market structure legislation and the monetization of its data center business, which is on track to recognize revenue from its CoreWeave (CRWV) lease in the coming weeks, are identifiable near-term positive catalysts, the analyst added.
> On Thursday, IREN(IREN) reported a Q2 loss per share of (52c) on revenue of $184.7M, which compared to a loss per share of (10c) last year and analyst revenue estimates of $226.9M. The company had cash and cash equivalents of $2.8B as of January 31. “Last quarter marked meaningful progress across capacity expansion, customer engagement, and capital formation, reflecting IREN’s progress as a scaled AI Cloud platform,” said Daniel Roberts, Co-CEO. “We are seeing the strongest demand environment to date, and importantly, that demand is being met by a proven execution capability. Over several years, we have consistently delivered data center capacity on time and at scale, and that delivery track record continues to resonate with customers who value reliability alongside performance. “With more than 4.5GW of secured power, we are able to advance a broad set of opportunities in our pipeline and support the next phase of growth. Our $3.4bn ARR target represents an early stage of monetization relative to the size of our secured power portfolio, highlighting the scale of the platform we are building.”
> Following the report, Cantor Fitzgerald lowered the firm’s price target on IREN to $82 from $136 and kept an Overweight rating on the shares. Revenue and adjusted EBITDA were both down quarter over quarter due to a decline in bitcoin prices and a decline in operating hash rate, which was not unexpected given the company’s transition of capacity away from bitcoin mining and towards AI compute, the analyst said. The firm believes the after-hours move lower is a buying opportunity. B. Riley raised the firm’s price target on IREN to $83 from $74 and kept a Buy rating on the shares. IREN reported Q2 adjusted EBITDA of $75.3M, below both internal and consensus estimates, while highlighting key milestones including securing $3.6B in GPU financing, adding 1.6 GW of power capacity at a new Oklahoma campus, and progressing Sweetwater 1 & 2 in Texas, the analyst said. Despite the shortfall, the company targets $3.4B in annualized run-rate revenue by end of CY26, with expansion across Horizon 1-4 and B.C. sites positioning IREN as a de-risked, compelling long-term growth story, the firm said
> MORE CRYPTO EARNINGS: On Thursday, CleanSpark (CLSK) reported a Q1 loss per share of ($1.35) on revenue of $181.2M, which compared to earnings per share of 85c last year and a revenue consensus of $187.73M. The company held $485.1M in cash and $1B in bitcoin as of December 31.
> “CleanSpark exited the quarter with one of the strongest balance sheets in our sector and a power and land portfolio that is increasingly scarce,” said Matt Schultz, CEO. “We strengthened our financial foundation, secured up to 890 megawatts of high-quality utility potential capacity in the Houston region, and materially advanced our Sandersville site with the acquisition of an additional 122-acre parcel as we progress toward AI tenancy. Importantly, this expansion is being funded from a position of strength. Our scaled bitcoin mining operations continue to generate durable cash flows, and those cash flows are now being redeployed into long-duration infrastructure opportunities that we believe can drive significant shareholder value over time.”
> Following the report, Needham lowered the firm’s price target on CleanSpark to $19 from $25 and kept a Buy rating on the shares. The company modestly missed on revenues and Adjusted EBITDA, primarily driven by lower mining, though the firm is lowering its estimates further as bitcoin prices have materially pulled back, the analyst said. Cantor Fitzgerald lowered the firm’s price target on CleanSpark to $17 from $21 and kept an Overweight rating on the shares. The investment case for CleanSpark has now shifted to AI, with what appears to be strong momentum for its Sandersville site, and the company is adding additional large site capacity behind that, the analyst said. The recent selloff makes shares attractive, the firm added. Meanwhile, Keefe Bruyette lowered the firm’s price target on CleanSpark to $14 from $18 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares. The firm maintains high conviction in a 2026 Sandersville lease given the site’s readiness, location, and active tenant engagement, which should help anchor shares near $10 despite BTC volatility, the analyst said.
> On Thursday, Bullish (BLSH) reported a Q4 loss per share of ($3.73) on an adjusted revenue of $92.5M, which compared to analyst estimates of earnings per share of 16c on revenue of $87.26M. Tom Farley, CEO, said, “I believe that we are at a turning point for digital assets. For all of crypto’s extreme volatility and cyclicality, the vision of faster, better, cheaper, permissionless capital is being unlocked in real-time to bring everything onchain. What I envision immediately ahead for this industry – and, particularly for Bullish, is why I came to the digital asset space.”
> Following earnings, Clear Street lowered the firm’s price target on Bullish to $42 from $50 and kept a Buy rating on the shares. The company reported strong Q4 results and the fiscal 2026 outlook is solid, the analyst said. Clear cited the “risk-off” environment, weak investor sentiment, and uncertainty surrounding the timing of market structure legislation for the target cut.
> Meanwhile, JPMorgan lowered the firm’s price target on Bullish to $41 from $42 and kept a Neutral rating on the shares. The firm views the company’s Q4 report as inline.
> On Friday, Mawson Infrastructure Group (MIGI) reported preliminary Q4 revenue of $3.2M. compared to revenue of $15.1M for the same period last year. The company also announced that it had reached a confidential settlement with Ionic Digital Mining to resolve claims Ionic brought against Mawson and two of its subsidiaries related to a co-location agreement. In addition, the company entered a separate, unrelated settlement to resolve a customer dispute over a hosting arrangement. Together, these resolutions eliminate a large portion of the company’s potential financial liability going forward. Mawson made no admission of liability or wrongdoing in reaching either of these settlements.
> “We are pleased to move forward from these pending cases and significantly reduce Mawson’s potential liability,” said Kaliste Saloom, Interim CEO and General Counsel of Mawson. “The clarity we now have on the future strength of our balance sheet will allow us to focus on driving operational execution and long-term growth for Mawson.”
> BED BATH & BEYOND TO ACQUIRE TOKENS.COM: Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) announced Monday that it has signed an agreement to acquire Tokens.com to establish a critical foundation for a unified investment and personal finance platform. The company said, “The platform will address a fragmented market for financial services by delivering a one-stop journey for real estate and other real-world asset finance that bridges tokenized and traditional investing. The platform will be integrated with our financial technology, insurance, and blockchain-based businesses. Bed Bath & Beyond currently maintains strategic investments and ownership interests in digital asset and blockchain businesses, including tZERO and GrainChain, held both directly and through its Medici portfolio. Tokens.com will be wholly owned by Bed Bath & Beyond and will benefit from Bed Bath & Beyond’s deep experience and history in the advancement of tokenized assets as an early investor and proponent of blockchain technology. The platform will be supported by shared expertise, regulatory experience, and proven infrastructure services across Bed Bath & Beyond’s portfolio.” Bed Bath & Beyond anticipates the Tokens.com platform becoming operational by July 1, subject to closing and customary conditions.
> “Our strategy brings together partners like Figure Technologies and Figure Markets, the infrastructure of tZERO, and the operating and AI integration capabilities provided by ShyftLabs,” said Marcus Lemonis, CEO. “Providing responsible, compliant liquidity pathways for homeowners and real-world asset holders is our strategy and long-term vision.”
> GEMINI TO EXIT OPERATIONS IN UK, EU, AUSTRALIA: In a Thursday regulatory filing, Gemini Space Station (GEMI) disclosed that the company approved a plan to exit and wind down its operations in the United Kingdom, the European Union and other European jurisdictions, and Australia as part of a broader initiative to reduce operating expenses and support the company’s path to profitability. “The company’s business will continue operating in the United States and Singapore. The Plan is expected to include a reduction in force of up to 200 global employees, including employees in Europe, the United States, and Singapore, and representing approximately 25% of the company’s total global workforce as of February 4, 2026. The company expects the Plan to be substantially completed in the first half of 2026, subject to applicable local law and consultation requirements. In connection with the Plan, the company currently estimates that it will incur pre-tax restructuring and related charges of approximately $11M, substantially all of which are expected to result in cash expenditures…The company expects to recognize substantially all of these charges in the first quarter of 2026, subject to the timing of actions taken under the Plan and applicable local law and consultation requirements,” the filing stated.
> Following the filing, Evercore ISI downgraded Gemini to In Line from Outperform with a price target of $10, down from $15. The firm said the market exits pushes out Gemini’s growth story.
> Additionally, Goldman Sachs lowered the firm’s price target on Gemini to $7.50 from $11.50 and keeps a Neutral rating on the shares. The wind down reflects the impact of the crypto sell-off on reducing crypto trading volumes, which has likely termed out Gemini’s path to profitability, Goldman contended.
> BITFARMS PLANS U.S. REDOMICILIATION: Bitfarms (BITF) announced Friday that its Board of Directors has approved a plan of arrangement under which the company will redomicile from Canada to the United States, subject to receipt of shareholder, stock exchange and court approvals. The arrangement is the culmination of a comprehensive strategic review process undertaken by the board over the past 12 months, including ongoing analysis of investor sentiment and capital markets trends to identify opportunities to enhance long-term shareholder value. The board unanimously determined that the U.S. redomiciliation is in the best interests of Bitfarms and unanimously recommends that the shareholders of the company vote in favor of the arrangement. Upon completion of the redomiciliation, the ultimate parent company of Bitfarms will be a corporation formed under the laws of the State of Delaware. It is anticipated that this new parent corporation will operate under the name Keel Infrastructure. To effect the redomiciliation, each outstanding common share of Bitfarms will be exchanged for one share of common stock of Keel Infrastructure pursuant to the arrangement. Upon completion, Keel Infrastructure US common stock is expected to trade on the Nasdaq and the Toronto Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol KEEL, subject to receipt of all necessary approvals of the Nasdaq and the TSX.  The redomiciliation is expected to be completed on or about April 1.
> CEO Ben Gagnon stated, “Bitfarms is officially launching the final phase of our pivot to the U.S., positioning us to more effectively execute on the significant opportunities we see ahead in HPC/AI infrastructure development. This transition will expand our access to new sources of capital, increase our eligibility for index inclusion, and simplify our story for U.S. investors, among other benefits that we believe support our ability to continue creating value for our shareholders. As a business, fortifying our U.S. footprint will bring significant benefits including reducing complexity for potential customers and enhancing our current relationships with suppliers and energy providers. We look forward to continued engagement with our shareholders to outline our clear path forward for value creation as a U.S. company.”

### 1. [Dialog continues positive turnaround](https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2026/02/11/dialog-continues-positive-turnaround)
**Source**: The Star | **Date**: 2026-02-11T12:44:00+00:00

> PETALING JAYA: Dialog Group Bhd is staying focused in the pursuit of its key long-term strategies, saying that it is confident that its business model is well structured to manage and sustain the group through periods of economic uncertainty, oil price volatility and currency movements.
> It said its core business remains intact as it realigns its focus to prioritise key competencies across all three of its upstream, midstream and downstream segments.
> Releasing its results for the second quarter ended Dec 31, 2025 (2Q26) for the financial year ending June (FY26), Dialog jumped back to the black by recording a net profit of RM137.7mil, from a loss of RM129.5mil a year ago.
> Revenue grew by 11.2% year-on-year (y-o-y) to RM756.3mil.
> “The healthy performance was driven by positive contributions from the group’s businesses, particularly its Malaysia operations,”Dialog said in a filing to Bursa Malaysia.
> Explaining further, it said its Malaysia operations had remained busy across the upstream, midstream and downstream businesses, translating into improved profit contribution overall in 2Q26.
> Dialog said its midstream operation registered increased earnings from healthy tank storage occupancy while the downstream operations achieved higher contributions on the back of cost optimisation initiatives and completion of several projects.
> “The upstream operations, however, saw a lower contribution due to reduced crude oil allocation and lower realised oil prices.
> “On the International front, the current financial quarter saw a slight decrease in profit contributions attributable to reduced business activities,” the group added.
> Profit contribution from joint ventures and associates for the current financial quarter was also higher against the same period last year, mainly due to favourable foreign exchange movement on US dollar liabilities at one of its associate companies, said Dialog.
> For the six months ended December (1H26), Dialog saw bottomline increase by almost thirteen-fold y-o-y to RM277.8mil, as turnover rose 7.5% to RM1.41bil.
> The group added that it has successfully eliminated negative contributions from a previously loss-making joint venture, which ceased operations last year.
> “Overall, the group’s performance underscores the resilience of its integrated business model and its ability to navigate fluctuating global oil prices and currency movements through diversified operations,” it said.
> The group had not announced any dividends for FY26.
> Moving forward, Dialog said it will continue to grow its presence in the upstream business through the development and rejuvenation of oil and gas fields, while for the midstream segment, the group will continue to invest in phased capacity expansions for dedicated long-term customers across its midstream terminals business portfolio.

### 3. [How Guyana's Oil Boom Will Reshape Energy Security](https://www.cfr.org/articles/how-guyanas-oil-boom-will-reshape-energy-security)
**Source**: Council | **Date**: 2026-02-11T14:11:00+00:00

> Roxanna Vigil is an international affairs fellow in national security at the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), sponsored by Janine and J. Tomilson Hill. Diana Roy is a senior writer and editor for Latin America at CFR.
> The “Americas quintet” of oil producers—the United States, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, and Guyana—is expected to reshape global oil markets by driving most of the non-Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) supply growth over the next ten years, according to the International Energy Agency. Guyana is the newcomer and the third-smallest country in South America, but its offshore oil discoveries have given it an outsize role in global energy markets.
> However, Guyana’s rapid transformation also raises questions about how the country—historically one of the poorest in the region—will sustainably manage its production and revenue. A long-standing territorial dispute with Venezuela adds another layer of complexity. Despite being one of the world’s fastest-growing economies, a large portion of Guyana’s population of less than one million lives in poverty, corruption persists, and concerns abound over how the country’s oil wealth may exacerbate existing political divisions, some of which fall along ethnic lines.
> For Guyana to achieve long-term growth, avoiding the so-called resource curse will be critical, particularly as its emergence as a major oil producer reshapes the regional energy landscape. Guyana’s strategic Caribbean location, democratic stability, and growing energy resources—combined with the need to counter Venezuelan aggression—make it a compelling partner for advancing U.S. regional interests.
> Guyana is the world’s newest petrostate, with major offshore oil discoveries by ExxonMobil and its partners in the last decade transforming the small South American country from a net energy importer into one of the fastest-growing oil producers globally. Guyana’s total—and largely recoverable—proven oil reserves are now estimated to be at about eleven billion barrels, surpassing producers like Norway and ranking it among the world’s top twenty oil reserve holders. Most of these oil reserves are in the offshore Stabroek Block, approximately 120 miles off Guyana’s coast. Other major players in the ExxonMobil-led consortium include Chevron and CNOOC, China’s largest state-owned offshore oil and gas producer.
> Oil production has expanded rapidly under the consortium, and Guyana is now the world’s largest oil producer on a per capita basis. As of late 2025, Guyana was producing roughly 900,000 barrels per day, with capacity projected to reach around 1.7 million barrels per day by 2030. The country’s oil revenues—which to date exceed $8 billion—have driven exceptional economic growth, with real gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaging 47 percent per year since 2022.
> In 2024, Guyana’s oil exports primarily went to Europe (66 percent) and the United States (29 percent). European demand for Guyana’s crude oil surged after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, as refiners sought alternatives to sanctioned Russian supplies. Supply increases from the United States and growing production in Brazil, Canada, and Guyana enabled Europe to impose sanctions on Russia without triggering global shortages. Together, the Americas quintet is expected to drive nearly all non-OPEC oil supply growth in the short to medium term, with output likely helping to dampen oil price volatility during future international crises.
> In addition to oil, Guyana has an estimated 16 trillion cubic feet of proven natural gas reserves. Although Guyana currently has no gas pipeline infrastructure, a gas-to-energy project is expected to deliver approximately 50 million cubic feet of natural gas per day from the Stabroek Block’s Liza field to a 300-megawatt power plant and natural gas liquids plant by the end of 2026. The project aims to reduce Guyana’s dependence on fuel oil for electricity generation, cutting both carbon emissions and electricity costs.
> To date, the natural gas from offshore oil production has been reinjected into wells to support production and used as on-site fuel. Longer term, ExxonMobil’s proposed Longtail project—the largest gas development in the Stabroek Block—could produce up to 1.5 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas and other petroleum products through a liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility.
> These natural gas developments position Guyana to address a critical regional energy challenge. Many Caribbean countries currently spend up to 15 percent of GDP on fuel oil imports for power generation, with petroleum products representing 87 percent of the region’s primary energy consumption. The region faces an acute supply gap as Trinidad and Tobago—the Caribbean’s traditional LNG supplier with the region’s largest gas infrastructure—has seen LNG exports fall by 40 percent since the COVID-19 pandemic due to dwindling reserves.
> Energy security. Guyana’s expanding production capacity diversifies global oil sources, reducing traditional dependence on the Middle East while strengthening regional energy security and potentially influencing international price dynamics over the next decade. Guyana also has among the lowest global oil production costs and is well positioned to remain competitive as global oil demand plateaus and markets contract.
> Venezuela. Guyana’s rise is also likely to further inflame tensions with Venezuela over the Essequibo region, which is situated between the two countries and has been a point of contention for more than a century. Venezuela’s territorial claims to Guyana’s Essequibo region—roughly two-thirds of its territory—is an existential threat to Guyana. In December 2023, the Nicolás Maduro regime held a controversial referendum to establish Venezuelan sovereignty over the area. While the government claimed overwhelming approval among voters, independent observers reported extremely low turnout and questioned the legitimacy of the results. After the referendum, Maduro ordered the deployment of thousands of troops to the border. Venezuela’s increasingly aggressive posture has raised international concerns about possible annexation of the territory.
> Guyana has asked the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to rule on the territorial dispute, and a decision is expected in 2026. However, Venezuela doesn’t recognize the ICJ’s jurisdiction. The United States has consistently supported Guyana’s sovereignty and respected the ICJ process, while remaining open to bilateral negotiations if both parties agree. On a trip to Guyana in 2025, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio reaffirmed U.S. support for Guyana’s territorial integrity and warned Venezuela against trying to forcefully take the Essequibo. Guyanese President Mohamed Irfaan Ali welcomed continued U.S. support following the U.S. military’s removal of Maduro. China, which is part of the ExxonMobil-led consortium, has refrained from taking sides in the territorial dispute, but its call for negotiations without endorsing the ICJ process was criticized by Guyana as appeasing Venezuela’s desire to bypass the court.
> The Donald Trump administration’s intervention in Venezuela and its stated plan to indefinitely control oil sales introduces uncertainty about Venezuela’s future and regional stability. Complicating matters further, the Essequibo claim has broad support across Venezuela’s political spectrum, meaning the dispute is unlikely to disappear even if Venezuela eventually transitions to a democracy.
> United States. Strengthening military, economic, and diplomatic support for Guyana aligns with U.S. national security interests given Guyana’s growing role as an energy producer, its strategic location, and its leadership among democratic nations in the Caribbean. However, U.S. security commitments to Guyana remain uncertain under the Trump administration’s volatile approach to alliances and its willingness to renege on prior commitments. Moreover, Guyana may be wary of deepening military ties with an administration that has embraced an expansive interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine, raising questions about whether such a partnership would genuinely respect Guyana’s sovereignty or serve primarily as a vehicle for U.S. resource access.
> Despite these complications, the strategic case for supporting Guyana is compelling: preventing a Venezuela-Guyana conflict benefits broader regional stability, and a stable, democratic Guyana contributes to the Western Hemisphere’s energy security. Whether the current administration can deliver reliable, principle-based support—rather than transactional engagement driven by narrow resource interests—will likely determine the viability and sustainability of an enhanced partnership.
> Environmental. Guyana holds roughly 3 percent of the total Amazon Rainforest, which plays a critical role in global climate health, and boasts one of the highest forest coverage rates in the region, with about 85 percent of the country covered in rain forest.
> However, Guyana faces severe climate vulnerabilities. Most of the population lives on a low-lying coastal plain, protected only by a system of seawalls, extensive drainage canals, and mangrove forests. Although Guyana’s oil production represents a negligible share of global emissions, it poses direct environmental risks: spills could damage marine ecosystems, while increased industrial activity brings air and water pollution, habitat destruction, and general environmental degradation.
> Despite this, oil revenues could help fund improved flood defenses and climate adaptation infrastructures. In a 2025 interview with the New York Times, President Ali said Guyana can balance climate leadership with fossil fuel exploitation, saying that oil revenue will be used to fund investments in infrastructure and the energy transition.
> Economic. If its oil assets are not sustainably managed, Guyana risks falling victim to the so-called resource curse, of which neighboring Venezuela is a cautionary example. Compounding this risk, Guyana’s oil income is surging just as the world is shifting toward electrification and lower-carbon energy, threatening to lock the country into dependence on a depreciating asset and underscoring the importance of economic and energy diversification. While some analysts point to Norway as a model country [PDF] that has avoided these pitfalls, Guyana does not yet have the institutional capacity to replicate it. Guyana has created a sovereign wealth fund to help control oil revenues and fund national development, but it is too early to tell whether the country will be able to maximize the long-term social and economic benefits from its resources and strengthen its democracy.
> The International Monetary Fund has commended Guyana’s strong economic growth, noting its economic outlook “remains highly favorable.” But public reactions to the government’s management of its newfound wealth have been mixed. According to the Inter-American Development Bank, approximately 58 percent of Guyana’s population lives in poverty despite the oil boom. The management of the country’s new oil wealth was a key issue in Guyana’s 2025 presidential election, with some opposition parties arguing that oil revenues benefit politically connected elites more than ordinary citizens and promising they would seek to renegotiate the contract with ExxonMobil.
> Political. Guyana has long struggled with corruption, including bribery, embezzlement, and a weak rule of law. The country’s politics are also largely organized along ethnic lines, with the two major parties, the People’s Progressive Party/Civic (PPP/C) and the People’s National Congress (PNC) party, drawing primary support from the Indo-Guyanese and Afro-Guyanese populations, respectively. In 2020, Guyana held a general election after President David A. Granger’s government (led by a PNC-dominated coalition) lost a no-confidence vote in 2018. It was the first to occur since the 2015 oil discovery and was highly contested, leading to a delayed transfer of power when Granger refused to accept the results. The advent of oil revenues intensified the political stakes [PDF] surrounding the election, as it generated expectations of broad economic improvements. Additionally, a major criticism of the opposition during the campaign was the ruling coalition’s failure to secure a better oil deal with international companies. If not properly managed, the influx of oil wealth risks further undermining democratic governance, entrenching inequality in an already unequal society, and reinforcing ethnic divisions.

### 4. [What's Driving Up Maine's Energy Bills? Natural Gas](https://ctnewsjunkie.com/2026/02/11/whats-driving-up-maines-energy-bills-natural-gas/)
**Source**: CT News Junkie | **Date**: 2026-02-11T13:45:00+00:00

> Natural gas, not solar panels and wind turbines, is the primary driver behind soaring power prices in Maine, according to a new report released this week by the state’s energy department. 
> Mainers pay some of the highest electricity rates in the country — only five states had higher residential prices in November 2025. They also spend a lot to heat their homes, given the prevalence of expensive fuel oil. Possible solutions to the problem of high energy costs are developing clean power, investing in load-flexibility strategies, and continuing to push for home-heating electrification, concludes the report, which was prepared by The Brattle Group.
> As Americans grapple with unprecedented utility bills, clean energy has increasingly become a scapegoat, in Maine and beyond. 
> President Donald Trump has been perhaps the most notable voice, branding solar and wind the ​“scam of the century,” though concerns about renewable energy and affordability have come from both sides of the aisle. In Maine, Democratic lawmakers voted last June to cut support for community solar as a way to lower energy costs, and some Massachusetts legislators have proposed pulling back on energy efficiency and renewable power initiatives.
> The new report is the latest in a growing body of research that challenges these arguments — and demonstrates that the major drivers of high energy costs have nothing to do with solar panels, wind turbines, or heat pumps. 
> The information comes just as the state launches the process of developing its latest two-year energy plan, which will take effect in 2027. The document outlines goals and lays out strategies for making energy cleaner, less expensive, and more reliable.
> “It’s helpful to have the information out there for the general public and policymakers to understand what really is driving energy price volatility here in Maine,” said Dan Burgess, acting commissioner of the state energy department under Democratic Gov. Janet Mills. 
> Transmission and distribution expenses are partially to blame for the state’s rising bills, thanks to growing equipment and construction costs, the need to replace aging infrastructure, and repairs following storms.
> But the factor that most influences power costs in Maine is the volatility of natural gas prices, the report finds. Maine is part of the six-state New England grid, which gets more than half its electricity from gas-burning power plants. Roughly 80% of the time, natural gas is the marginal generation resource — that is, it is the most expensive power source, which sets the price for all the energy flowing onto the grid at that moment. 
> “Natural gas is almost always what is setting the price here in New England,” Burgess said.
> Between 2021 and 2023, electricity supply prices in Maine nearly tripled, rising from 6.4 cents per kilowatt-hour to 17 cents per kilowatt-hour. During that period, natural gas prices spiked in response to three winter storms and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. 
> Natural gas market trends suggest the fuel is only going to get more expensive, the report finds. As the United States continues to expand its liquefied natural gas export capacity, more competition for the supply is likely to drive up prices. Surging demand for electricity to power data centers — even those built beyond New England — could also increase natural gas prices nationally. 
> Some, including in the Trump administration, have argued that this issue is further exacerbated by New England’s failure to expand gas supply to keep pace with growing energy demand. Critics of that approach say it is misguided, however, and the Maine report does not suggest pipeline expansion as a solution to the state’s energy-cost problems. 
> Instead, the analysts propose three main paths toward more affordable energy bills in Maine. The first is accelerating clean energy development so that volatile natural gas prices have less impact — a feat made more difficult by the Trump administration’s vehement opposition to offshore wind, which was meant to be a cornerstone of the New England grid. The second is adopting what the report calls ​“load flexibility,” which means shifting some demand, like EV charging, to hours when there is less load on the grid. 
> The third is continuing the electrification of home heating. 
> Maine has earned headlines for its success in promoting heat pump installations; it hit its goal of 100,000 new heat pumps in 2023, two years before the target date, and is now aiming for a total of 275,000 new installations by 2027. In a state where roughly half of households still use heating oil for warmth, heat pumps offer a more affordable option than the pricey fossil fuel.
> “We’re still the most home-heating-oil–reliant state in the country,” Burgess said. ​“Switching to heat pumps can reduce energy expenses.”

> The information comes just as the state launches the process of developing its latest two-year energy plan, which will take effect in 2027. The document outlines goals and lays out strategies for making energy cleaner, less expensive, and more reliable.
> “It’s helpful to have the information out there for the general public and policymakers to understand what really is driving energy price volatility here in Maine,” said Dan Burgess, acting commissioner of the state energy department under Democratic Gov. Janet Mills. 
> Transmission and distribution expenses are partially to blame for the state’s rising bills, thanks to growing equipment and construction costs, the need to replace aging infrastructure, and repairs following storms.
> But the factor that most influences power costs in Maine is the volatility of natural gas prices, the report finds. Maine is part of the six-state New England grid, which gets more than half its electricity from gas-burning power plants. Roughly 80% of the time, natural gas is the marginal generation resource — that is, it is the most expensive power source, which sets the price for all the energy flowing onto the grid at that moment. 
> “Natural gas is almost always what is setting the price here in New England,” Burgess said.
> Between 2021 and 2023, electricity supply prices in Maine nearly tripled, rising from 6.4 cents per kilowatt-hour to 17 cents per kilowatt-hour. During that period, natural gas prices spiked in response to three winter storms and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. 
> Natural gas market trends suggest the fuel is only going to get more expensive, the report finds. As the United States continues to expand its liquefied natural gas export capacity, more competition for the supply is likely to drive up prices. Surging demand for electricity to power data centers — even those built beyond New England — could also increase natural gas prices nationally. 
> Some, including in the Trump administration, have argued that this issue is further exacerbated by New England’s failure to expand gas supply to keep pace with growing energy demand. Critics of that approach say it is misguided, however, and the Maine report does not suggest pipeline expansion as a solution to the state’s energy-cost problems. 
> Instead, the analysts propose three main paths toward more affordable energy bills in Maine. The first is accelerating clean energy development so that volatile natural gas prices have less impact — a feat made more difficult by the Trump administration’s vehement opposition to offshore wind, which was meant to be a cornerstone of the New England grid. The second is adopting what the report calls ​“load flexibility,” which means shifting some demand, like EV charging, to hours when there is less load on the grid. 
> The third is continuing the electrification of home heating. 
> Maine has earned headlines for its success in promoting heat pump installations; it hit its goal of 100,000 new heat pumps in 2023, two years before the target date, and is now aiming for a total of 275,000 new installations by 2027. In a state where roughly half of households still use heating oil for warmth, heat pumps offer a more affordable option than the pricey fossil fuel.
> “We’re still the most home-heating-oil–reliant state in the country,” Burgess said. ​“Switching to heat pumps can reduce energy expenses.”
