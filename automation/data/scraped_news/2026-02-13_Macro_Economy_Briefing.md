> Latest US inflation data shows the Federal Reserve has the space to

>             unlikely to do so at its next meeting, says the CEO of global
>             financial advisory giant deVere Group.
> The analysis from Nigel Green comes as January’s CPI report
>             confirms annual inflation has cooled to 2.4%, down from 2.7% in
>             December and easing steadily from just above 3% in September.
> Core inflation remains contained, with both headline and core prices
>             rising 0.3% month-on-month.
> Nigel Green says: “An annual rate of 2.4% places inflation
>               back within a historically stable corridor for the US
>               economy.”
> “Price growth is no longer running at levels that justify
>               emergency-era restraint.”
> He continues: “Inflation has drifted lower for four

>               Instead, we are seeing moderation.”
> With the fed funds target range currently at 3.5% to 3.75%, real
>             interest rates remain firmly positive relative to a 2.4% inflation
>             rate.
> “Policy is still restrictive in real terms,” explains
>               the CEO.
> “Borrowing costs are materially higher than underlying
>               inflation. The stance was appropriate when inflation was
>               surging, but it’s increasingly misaligned with present
>               conditions.”
> He adds: “Recent CPI releases have come in below consensus
>               expectations. As inflation eases, core pressures are contained,
>               and expectations remain anchored, monetary policy should adjust
>               accordingly.”
> Nigel Green is now urging the Federal Reserve to act decisively at
>             its next meeting taking place March 17-18.
> “The Fed should cut rates at the upcoming meeting,”
>               he says. “A measured reduction would acknowledge the
>               progress made on inflation and prevent unnecessary drag on the
>               economy.”
> Waiting, he argues, carries its own risks.
> “Keeping rates elevated for too long risks
>               overtightening,” Nigel Green warns.
>               “Interest-sensitive sectors, including housing and business

>               costs.”
> “A modest cut would maintain credibility while aligning

> Despite this, he believes policymakers are inclined to maintain a
>             hawkish posture.
> “The Fed is likely to emphasize that inflation remains above
>               its 2% target.”
> “Officials are highly sensitive to the perception of easing
>               prematurely. Institutional caution is shaping their

> He adds: “Credibility matters. However, credibility is also
>               strengthened by responding appropriately to incoming data. The
>               numbers now support a rate cut.”
> Nigel Green stresses that financial markets are already adjusting to
>             the improved inflation environment.
> “Bond markets are factoring in the likelihood of easing
>               later this year. Equity investors understand that inflation near
>               2.4% reduces the risk of further tightening. Acting sooner rather

>               it.”
> He concludes: “The Federal Reserve has the room to cut, and

### 4. [Canadian Dollar holds losses near 1.3600 as US jobs data dims Fed rate cut expectations](https://www.fxstreet.com/news/canadian-dollar-holds-losses-near-13600-as-us-jobs-data-dims-fed-rate-cut-expectations-202602130224)
**Source**: FXStreet | **Date**: 2026-02-13T02:24:00+00:00

> The USD/CAD pair posts modest gains around 1.3615 during the Asian trading hours on Friday. The US Dollar (USD) edges higher against the Canadian Dollar (CAD) amid expectations that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will not cut interest rates in the near term. The US Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation report will be in the spotlight later on Friday.
> The US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) rose by 130,000 in January, above the market consensus of 70,000, while the Unemployment Rate edged lower to 4.3% during the same period. The recent stronger-than-expected US jobs data reduces the chances the US central bank will see a need to cut interest rates again by midyear, which underpins the Greenback against the CAD.
> Meanwhile, crude oil prices fall amid expectations of a slowdown in global oil demand for 2026. This, in turn, weighs on the commodity-linked Loonie. It is worth noting that Canada is a major oil-exporting country, and low crude oil prices generally have a negative impact on the CAD.
> On the other hand, dovish remarks from Fed officials could drag the USD lower in the near term. Fed Board of Governors member Stephan Miran said on Friday that monetary policy has passively tightened. Miran added that the central bank can afford to have lower interest rates.
> Traders currently priced in nearly a 92% odds that the Fed will hold rates steady at its next meeting, although the chance of a rate cut at its June meeting is now at over 60%%, according to the CME FedWatch tool.
> (This story was corrected on February 13 at 08:11 GMT to say that the chance of a Fed rate cut at the June meeting is now at over 60%, not nearly 50%.)
> The key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada’s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada’s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment – whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) – with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.
> The Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting  interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.
> The price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is  Canada’s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.
> While inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to put up interest rates which attracts more capital inflows from global investors seeking a lucrative place to keep their money. This increases demand for the local currency, which in Canada’s case is the Canadian Dollar.
> Macroeconomic data releases gauge the health of the economy and can have an impact on the Canadian Dollar. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, employment, and consumer sentiment surveys can all influence the direction of the CAD. A strong economy is good for the Canadian Dollar. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the Bank of Canada to put up interest rates, leading to a stronger currency. If economic data is weak, however, the CAD is likely to fall.
> Lallalit Srijandorn is a Parisian at heart. She has lived in France since 2019 and now becomes a digital entrepreneur based in Paris and Bangkok.
> EUR/USD regains upside traction, returning to the 1.1880 zone and refocusing its attention to the key 1.1900 barrier. The pair’s slight gains comes against the backdrop of a humble decline in the US Dollar as investors continue to assess the latest US CPI readings and the potential Fed’s rate path.
> GBP/USD maintains its upside momentum in place, hovering around daily highs near 1.3650 and setting aside part of the recent three-day drop. Cable’s improved sentiment comes on the back of the Greenback’s  irresolute price action, while recent hawkish comments from the BoE’s Pill also collaborate with the uptick.
> Gold is reclaiming part of the ground lost on Wednesday’s marked decline, as bargain-hunters keep piling up and lifting prices past the key $5,000 per troy ounce. The precious metal’s move higher is also underpinned by the slight pullback in the US Dollar and declining US Treasury yields across the curve.
> Bitcoin's upside remains largely constrained amid weak technicals and declining institutional interest. Ethereum trades sideways above $1,900 support with the upside capped below $2,000 amid ETF outflows.
> US GDP and PCE inflation are main highlights, plus the Fed minutes. UK and Japan have busy calendars too with focus on CPI. Flash PMIs for February will also be doing the rounds. RBNZ meets, is unlikely to follow RBA’s hawkish path.
> Ripple edges up above the intraday low of $1.35 at the time of writing on Friday amid mixed price actions across the crypto market. The remittance token failed to hold support at $1.40 the previous day, reflecting risk-off sentiment amid a decline in retail and institutional sentiment.

### 5. [Gold Prices Surge Amid US Inflation Data Boost](https://www.devdiscourse.com/article/headlines/3804459-gold-prices-surge-amid-us-inflation-data-boost)
**Source**: Devdiscourse | **Date**: 2026-02-13T15:02:00+00:00

> Gold prices have climbed by over 1% due to weaker-than-anticipated US inflation data, bolstering market hopes for Federal Reserve rate cuts this year. This rise offsets earlier concerns from stronger-than-expected employment figures earlier in the week. As of 09:12 a.m. ET, spot gold stood at $4,992.27 per ounce, marking a weekly increase of 0.6%, despite Thursday's 3% drop.
> In tandem, US gold futures for April delivery went up by 1.3% to $5,013.60 per ounce. Tai Wong, an independent metals trader, attributed the boost to a mild Consumer Price Index (CPI) reading, which helped calm nerves eased by robust employment data. Spot silver also gained 2.7% to $78.72 per ounce, recovering from an 11% decline.
> Market participants now expect 63 basis points in rate cuts by the year's end, with the first anticipated in July. Data on Wednesday revealed that the US added 130,000 jobs in January, surpassing the forecast of 70,000. This data, alongside strong gold demand in China, has influenced the market, pushing ANZ analysts to raise their Q2 gold forecast to $5,800 per ounce.

> Most emerging market ETFs are built around the same assumption: that China’s economy and equity markets will drive returns for decades. Columbia EM Core ex-China ETF (NYSEARCA:XCEM) rejects that premise entirely. This fund excludes Chinese equities altogether, offering investors exposure to emerging markets without the geopolitical risk, currency volatility, and regulatory uncertainty that have defined Chinese markets in recent years.
> For investors who believe China’s best days are behind it, or who simply want to diversify away from concentration risk in the world’s second-largest economy, XCEM provides a clear alternative. The question is whether removing China from the equation actually improves returns or just creates a different set of risks.
> South Korean semiconductors dominate XCEM’s portfolio, with Samsung Electronics at 6.64%—a reflection of Korea’s dominance in memory chips and the AI boom driving demand. This concentration in Korean tech represents a bet that semiconductor demand will continue to outpace broader emerging market growth, particularly as AI applications expand globally.
> The fund’s second major theme is India’s financial sector transformation, anchored by positions in ICICI Bank and other major lenders. These holdings capture India’s digitization wave and credit expansion as the country’s banking system modernizes and reaches previously underserved populations.
> The fund maintains a 16.56% cash position, unusually high for an equity ETF. This defensive stance may reflect uncertainty about emerging market valuations or simply recent inflows awaiting deployment. Beyond these core positions, the portfolio reaches into Middle Eastern financials, Taiwanese electronics, and Brazilian industrials, creating a mosaic of ex-China emerging market exposure.
> At 0.16% annually, XCEM’s expense ratio is competitive for this level of geographic targeting. The fund has attracted $1.5 billion in assets since its September 2015 launch, suggesting investors see value in emerging market exposure without China’s regulatory uncertainty.
> The fund returned 49.56% over the past year, driven primarily by its heavy allocation to South Korean semiconductors during the AI boom. This sector concentration allowed XCEM to capture gains that traditional emerging market funds with significant China exposure missed, as Chinese tech companies faced regulatory crackdowns while Korean chipmakers benefited from surging AI-related demand.
> Over five years, the performance gap widens even further. XCEM gained 50.83% while iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (NYSEARCA:EEM) returned just 18.41%. This divergence reflects how China’s regulatory crackdowns and economic slowdown weighed on broader emerging market returns, while XCEM’s ex-China positioning allowed it to avoid these headwinds entirely.
> Much of XCEM’s outperformance comes from its heavy weighting in South Korean semiconductors. The iShares Semiconductor ETF (NYSEARCA:SOXX) gained 60.79% over the past year, and XCEM’s exposure to Samsung and SK Hynix allowed it to capture much of that upside.
> Excluding China means missing any potential recovery in Chinese equities. If Chinese markets rebound, XCEM will lag. The fund also has significant concentration in semiconductors, which exposes investors to cyclical risk in the chip industry. Finally, the large cash position may be a drag on returns if markets continue to rise.
> XCEM works for investors who want emerging market exposure without China’s regulatory and currency risks, but it requires accepting that you may underperform if Chinese equities recover.

### 2. [Economic diplomacy 2025: Turning the tide, unlocking resources, shaping new development space](https://en.qdnd.vn/politics/news/economic-diplomacy-2025-turning-the-tide-unlocking-resources-shaping-new-development-space-587901)
**Source**: People’s Army Newspaper Online | **Date**: 2026-02-13T16:25:00+00:00

> The insights were shared by Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Nguyen Minh Hang while talking to the press on this breakthrough journey.
> According to her, in 2025, the world continued to experience rapid, profound, and unpredictable changes. Global economic growth slowed, instability risks increased, strategic competition intensified, and tariff policies and trade protectionism expanded. The restructuring of supply chains and value chains, along with fragmentation trends in trade, technology, and green and digital development standards, became increasingly evident. Domestically, unprecedented natural disasters and floods caused severe damage, making development challenges demand stronger governance capacity and adaptability than ever before.
> In that context, Hang said that economic diplomacy closely followed the leadership of the Party, the State, and the Government, and was implemented in a synchronized, methodical, and decisive manner - both in breadth and depth - achieving many important results described by Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh at the conference reviewing economic diplomacy in 2025 on January 10, 2026 as a process of “transforming the state of play and turning the tide.”
> Last year, economic diplomacy maintained proactive positioning amid volatility, generated momentum amid difficulties, and laid the groundwork for breakthroughs, she said, adding it contributed effectively to growth objectives, strengthened confidence, and expanded development space.
> “Economic diplomacy shifted its mindset from accompanying growth to pioneering the creation of development opportunities, generating strategic space, mobilizing resources, and laying the foundation for deeper integration into global value chains,” she held.
> The most notable imprint, Hang noted, was the elevation of Vietnam’s strategic position, creating political and diplomatic leverage and opening up new cooperation opportunities.
> Over the past year, 75 foreign activities by key leaders were carried out, relations with 17 countries were upgraded, and a record 350 cooperation agreements were signed - 2.5 times higher than in 2024, focusing on economic, trade, investment, science and technology, innovation, and digital transformation.
> These were not merely documents, but the establishment of unprecedented favorable political-economic space with leading partners, providing a critical basis for attracting high-quality investment, expanding sustainable markets, improving access to and ownership of technology, and enhancing the economy’s capacity and competitiveness.
> Second, she said economic diplomacy contributed breakthroughs to strengthening domestic economic capacity. In 2025, Vietnam officially entered the group of the world’s 15 largest trading nations, with total import-export turnover exceeding 930 billion USD.
> Diplomacy played a “path-opening” role in enabling key agricultural exports such as durian, edible bird’s nest, and passion fruit to penetrate deeply into the Chinese market; addressing tariff issues with the United States; placing Vietnam in a priority group for negotiating fair trade agreements; expanding into promising new markets such as Latin America, the Middle East–Africa, Central Asia, Central and Eastern Europe, and Halal markets. It also advocated for the opening of numerous new international direct air routes despite complex geopolitical conditions, contributing to a record 21.5 million international tourist arrivals, the highest ever.
> Third, an important “state transformation” highlight was science and technology diplomacy, promoted across multiple dimensions from policy formulation and framework establishment to business and investment connectivity both domestically and internationally, multilateral cooperation enhancement, and mobilization of knowledge networks. This contributed to building 11 strategic technology groups and substantively implementing Politburo Resolution 57.
> According to the Deputy FM, economic and science-technology content became central to foreign affairs activities, especially high-level diplomacy, generating strong momentum for Vietnam’s economic, trade, and technological relations with partners. As a result, Vietnam has gradually forged strategic linkages in future-oriented technology sectors.
> The establishment of AI and semiconductor R&D centers in Vietnam by corporations such as NVIDIA, Qualcomm, and Samsung; Dassault Systèmes launching its R&D Center and Center of Excellence for digital twin and AI; ASML considering opening a representative office and committing to support semiconductor training and development; and Viettel commencing construction of Vietnam’s first high-tech semiconductor chip manufacturing plant - all demonstrate recognition of Vietnam’s potential and new standing in the global value chain, she stressed.
> Institutionally and strategically, Hang stated that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has issued an Action Plan for science and technology diplomacy through 2030 and is submitting to the Government a strategy for international cooperation on strategic technologies to 2030, with a vision to 2045. The overarching spirit is to make science, technology, and innovation diplomacy a priority pillar of foreign affairs in service of development.
> She said that economic diplomacy has become more substantive in supporting and connecting localities and businesses. Efforts to promote the Vietnamese brand have seen clear progress. In 2025, Vietnam’s overseas representative missions organized nearly 500 trade, investment, and tourism promotion activities; supported localities in hosting over 150 events; and facilitated the signing of around 100 cooperation agreements between localities and international partners.
> Diplomacy has accompanied local authorities and enterprises in removing bottlenecks, opening access channels, and bringing Vietnamese goods, brands, and products closer to key and emerging markets, she added.
> Predicting some major international trends in 2026, Hang pointed out growth slowdown, potential instability triggered by conflicts, tariff policies, policy adjustments by various countries, and competition for resources, markets, technology, and high-quality human resources. She also mentioned rapid technological innovation and the trend of technological decoupling, which concurrently facilitate accelerated development and make it difficult for countries to access advanced technologies, posing a significant risk of lagging behind.
> Globalization and international integration continue, but protectionism, fragmentation, clustering, and inequality are growing while geo-economic and political competition becomes increasingly fierce, especially in the Asia-Pacific and Southeast Asia, heaping pressure on small and medium-sized countries. Besides, traditional and non-traditional security issues have an increasingly profound impact on the security and development of many countries, she noted.
> The official described 2026 as a strategically significant year for Vietnam as it marks the first year of implementing the Resolution of the 14th National Party Congress and the 2026–2030 socio-economic development plan, initially establishing a long-term development model and growth trajectory for the country on the path towards the two strategic centenary goals.
> The Resolution of the 14th National Party Congress states that foreign affairs and international integration must play a pioneering and creative role and, alongside national defense and security safeguarding, serve as a "key and regular" task. It says a comprehensive foreign affairs strategy must be strongly implemented at a new level, contributing to the world economy, global politics, and human civilization.
> The new context, new potential, and new expectations present new tasks and requirements, demanding that economic diplomacy or, more broadly, foreign affairs serving development must constantly reform thinking, be sharp and decisive in implementation, be creative and groundbreaking in approach, and remain consistent with the principle of placing national interests first and above all else, with businesses and people at the center of service.
> Given this, Hang said, the guiding principle for economic diplomacy in 2026 is to create new development spaces; connect strategic resources and verify them through implementation effectiveness; resolutely accelerate the realization of the Party’s new viewpoints and guidelines and the State’s policies, especially the orientations set at the 14th National Party Congress and the resolutions of the Party, National Assembly and Government, the Politburo’s Resolution No.59, and the National Assembly’s Resolution No.250 on international integration; and transform strategic orientations into concrete, substantive, and measurable results.
> Highlighting five priorities of economic diplomacy in 2026 and the following years, she said that first, new growth drivers will be promoted, with science – technology diplomacy, semiconductor diplomacy, and digital economy diplomacy as central and breakthrough drivers of economic diplomacy in the new era. Vietnamese businesses’ capabilities of researching, accessing, and mastering technology will be enhanced while support given to the formation of R&D clusters, innovation centers, high-tech human resources training cooperation programs, and digital ecosystem connectivity.
> Vietnamese technology companies will also receive assistance in expanding to foreign markets, seeking opportunities for mergers and acquisitions, and connecting with multinationals, especially large technology corporations worldwide. Efforts will also be made to attract overseas Vietnamese scientists.
> Second, the Deputy Minister went on, breakthroughs will be made in expanding markets and supply chains with potential partners in the Middle East, Africa, Latin America, Eastern Europe, and Central Asia. At the same time, cooperation with major and traditional partners will be consolidated and expanded, and new cooperation frameworks leveraged to broaden development opportunities.
> Vietnamese-branded products will be further promoted and marketed abroad. Negotiations on free trade agreements (FTA) with Bangladesh, Pakistan, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) members, African countries such as Egypt and Algeria, and the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) are set to gain speed, and the signing of an FTA with the Southern Common Market (MERCOSUR) expedited.
> Third, priority will be given to supporting localities and businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, to enhance the effectiveness of international economic integration and leverage commitments. Businesses will be helped to expand investment and operations in international markets and participate more deeply in global value chains. The potential, strengths, and new development spaces of localities will be maximized following the launch of the two-tiered local administrative system, according to Hang.
> Fourth, the quality and practicality of research will be further improved to stay connected with real-life situations and promptly propose "accurate" and "correct" policies, simultaneously creating strategic space and promoting the pillars of domestic development.
> Fifth, she added, Vietnam will strengthen and elevate multilateral diplomacy and international economic integration, proactively engage in the shaping of new rules and norms and, at the same time, prepare well to chair important multilateral mechanisms, with high priority given to completing all-round preparations for APEC Year 2027.
> The Deputy Minister said that 2026 will be the year when economic diplomacy shifts sharply from "paving the way" to "facilitating development", from "connecting opportunities" to "connecting strategic resources", and from "making commitments" to "verifying effectiveness."
> She underlined the network of 17 free trade agreements and diplomatic relations with 194 countries, including comprehensive or higher-level partnerships with 42 countries, 17 of which are G20 members, and comprehensive strategic partnerships with all five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.
> However, she perceived that this foundation is only meaningful when it is transformed into concrete values, high-quality investment projects, sustainable export markets, technology and knowledge to support innovation, secure supply chains, enhance Vietnamese businesses’ competitiveness, and improve the country’s stature in the region and the world.
> The official expressed her belief that with the attention, leadership, and guidance from the Party, State, and Government, together with solidarity, concerted efforts, the determination to innovate and the strong involvement of the entire political system, economic diplomacy in 2026 will create new impetus for Vietnam to accelerate, break through, and advance quickly, strongly, and steadily in the era of the nation’s rise, contributing to the realization of the aspiration for a strong and prosperous Vietnam.

### 3. [Week Ahead: US GDP and Inflation in Focus, FOMC Minutes, RBNZ, UK and Japan CPI](https://www.investing.com/analysis/week-ahead-us-gdp-and-inflation-in-focus-fomc-minutes-rbnz-uk-and-japan-cpi-200675012)
**Source**: Investing.com | **Date**: 2026-02-13T15:40:00+00:00

> JAPANESE PRELIM GDP (SUN): Q4 Q/Q GDP is forecast to have risen 0.4%, with Y/Y growth seen at 1.6%. ING expects a more modest 0.3% Q/Q expansion, driven by a rebound in construction as the impact of temporary safety regulations fades and firmer exports supported by robust global semiconductor demand. January trade data highlight continued strength in chip exports, with favourable calendar effects and a low base likely to boost headline export growth. The impact of supplementary budget spending is expected to become more evident in Q1 2026 rather than Q4, while no material effect from China-Japan disputes is anticipated in the Q4 data. Stable political conditions and strong chip demand are also seen underpinning manufacturing and services activity.
> CANADIAN CPI (TUE): The Canadian inflation report will help shape expectations for BoC policy. The BoC is currently on hold but is keeping its options open. Recent minutes said the policy rate is on the stimulative side of the Bank’s estimated neutral range, and policymakers agreed that holding rates at the current level was conditional on the economy evolving in line with their outlook, warning that heightened uncertainty has broadened the range of possible outcomes. Members said it was difficult to predict the timing and direction of the next policy move and would continue to monitor risks closely, standing ready to respond if the outlook changes. On inflation, the BoC noted that escalating tensions could disrupt global supply chains and weigh on activity, posing both upside and downside risks to prices. On the USMCA review, it said this posed downside risks to growth and could pull inflation lower if the economy weakens, though higher import costs, potential counter-tariffs and supply chain disruptions could lift inflation. Amid the uncertainty, the BoC agreed to maintain optionality in setting policy. In a speech, Governor Macklem stressed the bank must be careful not to misdiagnose economic weakness, saying policy should not attempt to offset lost supply, particularly as the Canadian economy undergoes structural change. Money markets are pricing no change in rates for the remainder of the year.
> RBA MINUTES (TUE): The RBA will release minutes of its meeting earlier this month, when it raised the Cash Rate for the first time in more than two years by 25bps to 3.85%, as expected, with the decision unanimous. The bank said inflation was likely to remain above target for some time and that broad measures of wage growth continued to be strong. It added that labour market conditions were somewhat tight and capacity pressures greater than previously assessed and noted uncertainty around the outlook for domestic economic activity and inflation, and the extent to which monetary policy is restrictive. The RBA also published its latest Quarterly Statement on Monetary Policy, stating that underlying inflation was higher than expected and that GDP growth had continued to pick up, with private demand surprisingly strong. It raised its trimmed mean and CPI inflation forecasts and lifted its December 2025 GDP projection but lowered its year-end GDP forecasts for December 2026 and December 2027. The forecasts assumed the Cash Rate at 4.2% in December 2026 and 4.3% in December 2027. Governor Bullock said at the press conference that the pulse of inflation was too strong and that high inflation hurt all Australians, adding that the Board believed inflation would take longer to return to target and could not allow it to get away.
> UK UNEMPLOYMENT/WAGES (TUE): November’s Unemployment rate came in above consensus at 5.1% (exp. 5.0%), with the overall skew from the series a dovish one, as while the hotter-than-expected wage figure was a hawkish impulse, it is a familiar one. This week’s series is expected to feature a steady unemployment rate and a decline in payrolls. As a reminder, the February BoE MPR saw the peak unemployment forecast raised to 5.3% from the previous, and current, rate of 5.1%; i.e. the MPC expects a further deterioration in the jobs market. Note, given the remarks by BoE’s Bailey in the last statement, wages are perhaps worth watching even closer than normal, after he caveated his increased confidence on the path of wage inflation by adding it is less clear when the inflation downside will feed into wages; i.e., a marked drop in wages could tilt him to a March cut vs current pricing for April. However, overall, the series will inform but is unlikely to determine the timing of the next BoE cut, with the week’s inflation series (see below) more pertinent in that deliberation.
> RBNZ ANNOUNCEMENT (WED): The RBNZ will hold its first policy meeting of the year next week, where it is widely expected to keep the Official Cash Rate unchanged at 2.25%, with money markets pricing a 98% probability of no change. The meeting will be the first under Governor Breman, who took office in December. At its previous meeting in November, the RBNZ cut rates by 25bps, its third consecutive reduction, bringing cumulative easing to 325bps since it began its rate-cutting cycle in August 2024. The bank left the door open to further moves, saying future changes to the OCR would depend on how the outlook for medium-term inflation and the economy evolves, although its projections implied a pause through 2026. The RBNZ noted that annual consumer inflation rose to 3% in the September quarter but said spare capacity in the economy should see inflation fall to around 2% by mid-2026, with risks to the outlook balanced.
> Then-Governor Christian Hawkesby said policymakers were well placed to mitigate risks and that the central projection was for the Cash Rate to remain on hold through 2026, while retaining full optionality with every option on the table. He later acknowledged the bank had lowered the cash rate significantly and was more confident the OCR was now stimulatory, adding that the hurdle for further cuts was high and that it could not keep the door open to easing indefinitely. Governor Breman has also signalled openness to further adjustments, but without urgency, saying the RBNZ had made significant progress towards its mandated objectives and was closely monitoring data, including inflation and GDP. She said there was no preset course for monetary policy and that the bank would adjust if the inflation outlook changed. Breman added that the economic outlook had evolved broadly in line with expectations and that the forward path for the OCR published in the November monetary policy statement pointed to a slight probability of another cut in the near term, though if conditions evolve as expected the OCR is likely to remain at 2.25% for some time.
> FOMC MINUTES (WED): The Fed left rates unchanged at 3.50-3.75%, as expected, in a 10-2 vote, with Governors Miran and Waller dissenting in favour of a 25bps reduction. Miran had previously voted for a 50bps cut in December. The January statement upgraded its economic assessment, replacing “economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace” with “expanding at a solid pace”, “job gains have slowed this year” with “job gains have remained low”, and “the unemployment rate has edged up” with it having “shown some signs of stabilisation”. It also simplified “inflation has moved up since earlier in the year and remains somewhat elevated” to “inflation remains somewhat elevated”. In its risk characterisation, December’s addition that the Committee “judges that downside risks to employment rose in recent months” was removed, leaving only that it is attentive to risks on both sides of the mandate. The statement’s tone was slightly more positive on the economy and labour market and broadly unchanged on inflation.
> Ahead of the decision, traders looked for signals on the future policy path, but the statement offered no immediate clues and Chair Powell’s press conference provided little by way of new information. Powell noted that decisions will be made on a meeting-by-meeting basis, guided by the data and balance of risks. He said policy is well positioned, reiterating it is currently within a plausible neutral range, but towards the higher end. If Fed sees goods pricing peaking over this year, that suggests the Fed can loosen policy further. Powell highlighted that data since the December meeting has improved the outlook. Inflation remains somewhat elevated. Goods and tariff-related inflation expected to peak around mid-2026, with many effects already passed through. He noted that the labour market has weakened alongside solid growth, but recent data suggests stabilisation following a period of cooling. Job gains remain subdued, and while risks to employment have diminished, they have not disappeared, making it difficult to judge whether the dual mandate is fully in balance.
> Since the January meeting, Governor Waller (voter) has argued policy remains too restrictive, the labour market “does not look remotely healthy”, and tariff-driven inflation should be looked through. Governor Miran (voter) has said underlying inflation is not problematic and rates should be materially lower, warning policy may be passively tightening, though he added that after this week’s jobs data his concerns about the labour market have eased slightly. Governor Cook (voter) stressed stalled disinflation and the need to maintain credibility. Vice Chair Jefferson (voter) described policy as well positioned, expects tariff effects to fade and inflation to ease in 2026. Logan and Hammack (both 2026 voters), characterised rates as around neutral, signalling no urgency to cut unless labour conditions deteriorate materially. Among non-voters, Musalem and Schmid cautioned against further easing with inflation near 3%, while Daly, Barkin and Bostic emphasised resilience but warned inflation remains above target. Note, the minutes are an account of the January 28th meeting, so it will not incorporate the January jobs report and CPI data.
> UK CPI (WED):December’s print was hotter-than-expected at the headline level, though subject to caveats amid Budget-driven tobacco changes and elevated airfares due to the timing of return flights over the Christmas period. Pertinently, the core Y/Y figure was either in-line or cooler depending on the consensus used; however, all services ticked higher, though by less than some expected. An unwinding of the one-off impacts in December should see the headline moderate in January, with Pantheon Macroeconomics forecasting a 3.0% Y/Y print, though that is above the BoE MPC’s 2.9% forecast.
> As a reminder, the February MPR saw the inflation forecasts lowered across the next three years, and the statement remarks that the “outlook for inflation over the next six months is notably lower than expected in November”, primarily due to energy prices, including the impact of fiscal policy. The January series will be the main factor informing on whether the BoE cuts in March (-19.5bps priced) or April (-26.9bps). The language from the statement was balanced and kept the focus on the medium term. As a reminder, February was a 5-4 split with Bailey the tie break; on inflation, the Governor said he expects to see “quite a sharp drop in inflation over coming months”. If CPI prints in-line with Pantheon’s view, that is undoubtedly a sharp drop. However, the “coming months” emphasis by Bailey skews the bias to April vs March. Overall, CPI will have the main role to play in determining the timing of a cut, and if we see the moderation desks are looking for in prices, along with continued labour market pressures, a wage pullback and/or soft retail metrics, then March may move towards being priced.
> AUSTRALIAN EMPLOYMENT (THU): Westpac expects employment to rise by 40k (prev. +65.2k), with the participation rate edging up to 66.8% (prev. 66.7%) and the unemployment rate ticking up to 4.2% (prev. 4.1%). The labour market ended 2025 on a choppy note, the bank says, with a weak November followed by a strong December, though analysts caution that seasonal volatility - particularly around year-end and January hiring patterns - complicates the signal. Westpac judges the data reflect a solid finish to 2025 rather than a clear re-tightening in conditions, with employment growth likely near its trough as care-sector effects unwind and private demand stabilises. January data will be closely scrutinised by the RBA amid renewed inflation pressures, with attention on participation dynamics, population re-benchmarking and "marginally attached" workers, which have distorted recent January prints. Westpac expects a flatter employment recovery through 2026 and a gradual drift higher in unemployment over the year.
> JAPANESE CPI (THU): Japan’s CPI is expected to slow sharply, with headline inflation seen at 1.5% Y/Y (prev. 2.1%), according to ING. The deceleration is largely attributed to government energy subsidies and stabilisation in food prices. ING expects inflation to moderate further in the coming months, reinforcing expectations that price pressures may remain contained in the near term. From a BoJ perspective, the central bank held rates steady in January to assess the impact of previous hikes and await key data from the Shunto spring wage negotiations.
> UK RETAIL SALES (FRI): Barclay’s consumer spending report for January showed a modest increase in car spending during one of the wettest months on record, with online and entertainment expenditures bolstered as a result. However, the weather would theoretically have had an impact on footfall to stores. Despite that, Barclays’ report showed retail spending rebounded 1.7% Y/Y after a relatively flat December, supported by January sales and online activity. On the point of footfall, the BRC report showed in-store sales having the “highest growth” in over six months, despite the poor weather. Overall, the series should be robust and broadly in-fitting with the December print of 0.4% Y/Y.
> EZ FLASH PMIs (FRI): Expectations are for Services to edge up from the prior reading, with some analysts seeing the Manufacturing component return to expansionary territory. As such, the Composite is expected to rise to 51.7 from 51.3. Taking a look at other activity figures, EZ Retail Sales fell 0.5% in December from +0.1% previously, while German Industrial Production missed forecasts by a wide margin, underscoring the uneven nature of the country’s recovery. This PMI report is unlikely to have a material impact on monetary policy, with the ECB reiterating that the Bank remains in a “good place”. February’s ECB statement said growth is resilient and recent communication has largely reiterated a data-dependent approach.
> Recent data has been broadly in line with staff projections, with increased focus on the stronger EUR and trade and geopolitical developments. The January report printed slightly below expectations, although the overall trend has been sideways. In the prior reading, HCOB said the “growth trajectory can be described as decent”, though not yet “comfortable”. Regionally, Germany, Italy and Spain have continued to expand since September, while France has been affected by the “difficult political situation”. Since the last report, the political backdrop has stabilised in the short-term after Prime Minister Lecornu forced an amended 2026 budget through.
> UK FLASH PMIs (FRI): Investec forecasts the UK Composite PMI at 53.6, marginally below the prior 53.7, with slight downticks expected in both Manufacturing and Services, suggesting a modest loss of momentum after the upward trend of recent months. Recent activity data have included a subdued December GDP report, alongside weak Manufacturing and Industrial Production figures. The report will be closely watched by policymakers at the BoE, which kept rates unchanged at 3.75% at its January meeting. The 5-4 vote split was more dovish than the expected 7-2. Governor Bailey described activity as “subdued”, while Lombardelli called it “weak”. Ramsden and Dhingra, who dissented in February, also took a downbeat view of the activity environment. The Bank cut its growth forecasts for Q1’26 and Q1’27. Money markets currently assign a 76% chance of a cut in March and have fully priced in a move by April. ING said that if recent weakness in growth and the labour market persists alongside easing wage growth, a March cut is “highly likely”.
> UK PSNB (FRI): December’s PSNB came in at GBP 11.6bln, around GBP 2.5bln below the consensus figure, however, still at an elevated level and the 10th highest December print on record, with the FY to December tally the 3rd highest on record. January’s data captures capital gains and self-assessment payments ahead of the end-January deadline, and as such the series can be volatile and subject to significant and often one-off swings. As a reminder, the OBR expects receipts from capital gains to increase substantially over the next few years; a factor that may be seen in the January figure if participants elected to sell-off assets ahead of the 2025 Autumn Budget. An increase in such payments (potentially sparking a negative borrowing figure) would be welcome by the Treasury and would, if only temporarily, provide a welcome positive headline on the UK economy for the Labour government at the moment.
> US PCE (FRI): PCE prices, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, will be critical for policymakers and markets in assessing the future path of interest rates. Consensus expects December PCE to show firmer price pressures than recent CPI prints, with measures such as food and producer prices pointing to upside risks. Analysts note that the ‘wedge’ between CPI and PCE could produce a hotter PCE reading, partly because PCE places greater weight on categories where prices are rising more sharply. At his press conference following the FOMC’s January meeting, Chair Powell said estimates based on CPI data indicate headline PCE rose 2.9% Y/Y in December, up from 2.8%, while core PCE, excluding food and energy, likely rose 3.0% Y/Y from 2.8%. He said the elevated readings largely reflect goods inflation boosted by tariffs.
> The Fed’s December projections pencilled in one additional cut for 2026, though policymakers have recently indicated this depends on further progress towards the inflation target, given the labour market has outperformed expectations. Powell reiterated that decisions will be taken on a meeting-by-meeting basis, guided by data and the balance of risks. He said inflation has evolved broadly as expected but remains somewhat elevated, with no progress on core PCE last year as the overshoot was driven mainly by goods prices, tariffs and one-off factors rather than demand. Goods and tariff-related inflation are expected to peak around mid-year, with many effects already passed through. Powell said that if tariff effects on goods prices peak this year, it would signal scope to loosen policy. Short-term market-based inflation expectations have fully retraced since “Liberation Day”, while longer-term measures indicate confidence that inflation will return to 2%.
> US GDP (FRI): The preliminary Q4 GDP estimate is expected to show US growth cooling from Q3’s 4.4% annualised pace. The Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow tracker models growth at 3.7%, revised down after softer core retail sales in December and downward revisions to November, pointing to moderation in consumer spending from the prior quarter’s 3.5% pace. Activity nevertheless appears resilient. In its December SEP, the Fed projected 2026 growth at 2.3%, upgraded from 1.8% in its September forecasts; in January, the FOMC described the economy as expanding at a “solid pace”, while Chair Powell said growth is on a firm footing despite trade policy changes, cautioning that quarterly GDP can be volatile. Vice Chair Jefferson has struck a cautiously optimistic tone on 2026, expecting growth slightly above trend. He highlighted the possibility that productivity gains, including from AI investment, could allow faster expansion without reigniting inflation, though he stressed it is too early to assess their durability. Some analysts say focus will be on whether Q4 confirms a controlled slowdown rather than a sharper loss of momentum, and the implications for policy. The Fed’s rate path appears to hinge on further progress towards its 2% inflation goal, with most policymakers seeking clearer evidence of disinflation before backing lower rates.

### 4. [Discover Hidden Gems: Top Undervalued Tech Stocks Poised for Growth in 2026](https://techannouncer.com/discover-hidden-gems-top-undervalued-tech-stocks-poised-for-growth-in-2026/)
**Source**: TechAnnouncer | **Date**: 2026-02-13T02:22:00+00:00

> The market can feel a bit wild sometimes, right? One minute things are up, the next they’re down. It makes finding good investments a bit tricky. But sometimes, when everyone else is worried, that’s when the real opportunities pop up, especially with tech companies. We’re talking about undervalued tech stocks here – companies that have solid stuff going on but aren’t getting a ton of attention. These are the kinds of places where you might find some serious growth potential for 2026 and beyond. Let’s check out a few that look pretty interesting.
> Constellation Software (TSX: CSU) has seen some ups and downs lately. While it gained about 6.6% this past week, it’s down 24.7% year-to-date. This kind of volatility might make some investors nervous, but it could also be a chance to get in on a solid company at a lower price.
> Constellation is known for quietly acquiring software companies. They focus on businesses where customers tend to stick around and keep paying for maintenance, which usually grows with inflation. It’s a strategy that doesn’t always grab headlines, but it seems to work. The company recently reported a pretty big jump in free cash flow – up 46% year-over-year in the third quarter of 2025. There was a dip in net income, but that was due to a one-time expense related to an investment.		
> 							Advertisement
> What’s really interesting is their financial health. Constellation has a strong balance sheet with $2.8 billion in cash. They’re currently trading at a valuation based on free cash flow that we haven’t seen since 2014. Considering their free cash flow grew by 27% in the first nine months of 2025, the stock looks pretty discounted right now. It’s a company that has a history of turning investments into significant returns, and the current market conditions might be setting it up for another run.
> Here’s a quick look at their recent performance:
> Despite the recent pullback, Constellation’s business model and financial strength suggest it could be a hidden gem for patient investors looking for long-term growth. You can check out their recent stock performance for more details.
> It feels like a lot of software companies have taken a beating lately, and Topicus.com (TSXV:TOI) is no exception. The stock has seen a pretty significant drop over the past year, and you might be wondering why. A big part of the worry seems to be around artificial intelligence and how it might shake things up. But here’s the thing: Topicus operates in a lot of niche markets, especially in Europe, serving industries like government, education, and banking. These sectors tend to move a bit slower when it comes to adopting new tech, and honestly, their customers aren’t exactly looking for disruption.
> In fact, Topicus might even benefit from AI. Think about it – they could use AI to build and improve their software, making it easier to adapt to new customers or uses. Plus, AI could help their clients sift through and use their data more effectively. It’s way too early to write this company off.
> Here’s a quick look at why it might be worth a second glance:
> Right now, the market seems to be focusing only on the potential downsides of AI for software companies, ignoring the upsides. This could be a chance for investors who don’t mind buying when others are selling. The company is expected to see over 20% growth in 2026, and it’s profitable growth with good cash returns. You can currently pick up this stock with an 11% free cash flow yield and an enterprise value to EBITDA ratio of just 11. That looks pretty attractive when you consider its growth prospects.
> Descartes Systems (TSX:DSG) is a company that provides logistics and supply chain solutions. Right now, it’s facing some headwinds because of global trade issues. Basically, when countries aren’t trading as much, it directly impacts Descartes’ business. We saw U.S. container imports drop late last year, and that kind of slowdown puts pressure on their stock price and makes revenue growth a bit sluggish.
> The company earns a good chunk of its money from the U.S., which is right in the middle of these trade tensions. This means if things get more complicated with international trade, and countries start working with more suppliers to avoid relying on just one, Descartes might have to adjust. It could take some time for them to expand their operations internationally to take advantage of these shifts.
> However, Descartes is being smart about it. They’re holding onto their cash, which is a good move when the economy is uncertain. They’ve got a decent amount saved up, which should help them get through any rough patches. The idea here is that if you’re willing to wait, and you don’t mind buying when things look a bit down, you could benefit when trade picks up again. It’s not a quick fix, though; recovering from something like this usually takes a few years. So, if you’re patient, picking up shares gradually during this downturn might pay off down the road when the supply chain landscape changes and trade volumes increase.
> Hive Digital Technologies is doing something pretty interesting. They’re shifting their focus from just mining Bitcoin to building data centers for artificial intelligence. Think about it, AI is only going to get bigger, and companies that can offer computing power for it at a lower cost are going to do well. Hive is trying to be one of those companies. They’re setting up these AI data centers in places like Paraguay where electricity is cheaper, which is a smart move to keep costs down. What’s also neat is that they’re using their existing Bitcoin inventory to fund this transition, meaning they aren’t taking on new debt. This gives them a lot of flexibility. A single big contract with a major AI player could really move the needle for their stock price.
> It’s a bit of a gamble, sure, but the demand for AI is pretty undeniable right now. If Hive can pull off this transition smoothly and offer competitive AI computing services, they could be in a good spot for the next wave of tech growth. It’s a different approach than just holding onto Bitcoin, and it taps into a different, potentially massive, market. The company’s stock price saw a nice bump recently, which is a good sign, even if it’s been a bit of a bumpy ride lately. They’re definitely a company to watch as they pivot their operations.
> FIT Hon Teng is a company that makes connectors. You know, those little bits that let you plug things in. They’re involved in making parts for consumer electronics, like smartphones and tablets, and also for cars. It seems like a pretty basic business, but it’s one that’s always needed.
> The company is currently trading at a significant discount to its estimated fair value, which could mean it’s a good deal for investors right now. They’ve got a lot of products, and they supply to some big names in the tech world. Think about how many devices we all use every day – they all need these connectors.
> Here’s a quick look at how they stack up:
> It’s not the flashiest part of the tech industry, but FIT Hon Teng plays a role that’s hard to replace. If they can keep up with the demand for smaller, more powerful devices and the increasing tech in cars, they could see some solid growth.
> Nayax is a fintech company that’s been quietly building a strong presence in the self-service retail and merchant space. They offer a pretty complete package of solutions, handling everything from payment processing to data management for unattended machines like vending machines, laundromats, and even EV charging stations. It’s one of those behind-the-scenes businesses that makes modern convenience possible.
> What’s interesting is how they’re positioned. They operate across a bunch of different regions, including the US, Europe, and Israel, which gives them a good spread. Their main revenue comes from internet software and services, which makes sense given the nature of their business. Nayax is currently trading at a discount to its estimated future cash flow, suggesting it might be a bit undervalued right now.
> Here’s a quick look at some of their financial projections:
> They’ve been making moves, too, with strategic partnerships and product updates aimed at making things smoother for both online and physical retail. It seems like they’re focused on growing their revenue streams and making their operations more efficient. If you’re looking for companies that are enabling the digital and physical retail blend, Nayax is definitely worth a second look. You can find more details about their financial health in their comprehensive financial report.
> Shenzhen Newway Photomask Making Co., Ltd. is a player in China’s tech scene, focusing on designing, developing, and making mask products. These are pretty important for making electronic components, which is where most of their money comes from. Right now, the company is trading at CN¥54.5, but based on what they might make in the future, it looks like it’s worth about CN¥81.85. That’s a pretty big difference, suggesting it’s undervalued by about 33.4%.
> What’s interesting is that their earnings are expected to jump up by over 35% each year. That’s faster than the rest of the Chinese market, which is a good sign. They’re also trying to raise some money through a new stock offering, which could give them more financial wiggle room. However, the dividend they pay out isn’t super high, and it’s not really covered by the cash they have left over after running the business.
> Here’s a quick look at their numbers:
> It seems like Shenzhen Newway Photomask Making could be one of those companies that flies under the radar but has solid potential for growth in the coming years.
> Sino Medical Sciences Technology (SHSE:688108) is a company that operates in the medical technology space, focusing on areas like cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. It’s interesting because it seems to be flying under the radar for many investors right now. The company’s stock is currently trading at a significant discount to its estimated fair value, suggesting a potential buying opportunity.
> Looking at the numbers, Simply Wall St data from February 2026 shows the stock at CN¥22.42, with an estimated fair value of CN¥44.52. That’s nearly a 50% discount, which is pretty substantial. This kind of gap between price and perceived value often catches the eye of value investors.
> Here’s a quick look at some of the data points:
> While the exact breakdown of their product lines and revenue streams can be complex, the core idea is that they are developing and marketing medical devices. The market for these kinds of technologies, especially those addressing major health concerns like heart and brain conditions, tends to have steady demand. Investors looking for exposure to the healthcare sector in Asia might find Sino Medical Sciences Technology an interesting prospect, especially given the current market conditions that might be undervaluing Asian stocks. It’s worth keeping an eye on how their product pipeline develops and how their market penetration grows over the next couple of years.
> It seems like Colliers International Group (TSX:CIGI) has been getting lumped in with software companies lately, and its stock price has taken a hit because of it. It’s down about 15% over the last six months, and even dropped 6.3% recently, just like a lot of tech stocks. Maybe some investors are confusing its ticker with a Canadian IT company? But here’s the thing: Colliers isn’t in the tech business at all. They actually operate a pretty diverse range of real estate and infrastructure services all over the world.
> Despite the stock’s recent slump, Colliers actually announced some pretty good news. They’re buying a Spanish engineering firm called Ayesa Engineering for around $700 million. This move really beefs up their engineering capabilities in Europe and the Middle East, and it seems like a key piece in building out their engineering side of the business. It’s gotten so big that some people are even wondering if it could eventually be spun off as its own company.
> Right now, Colliers is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of about 17, and its free cash flow yield is sitting at 6%. Considering the company has grown its revenues by 19% and adjusted earnings per share by 22.5% so far this year, it looks like a pretty decent deal from a value perspective. This disconnect between its actual business and its stock performance might be an opportunity for investors who see the real value.
> Here’s a quick look at some of their financial highlights:
> Exel Composites Oyj is a company that makes composite profiles. Think of them as specialized plastic and fiberglass parts used in all sorts of things, from construction to industrial equipment. They’ve been around for a while, and they’re pretty good at what they do, focusing on custom solutions for their clients.
> Lately, the market seems to be overlooking Exel Composites. Based on some recent financial data, the stock is trading at a significant discount to its estimated fair value. For instance, it’s been noted that Exel Composites Oyj (HLSE:EXL1V) was trading around €0.536, while its estimated fair value was closer to €1.06. That’s nearly a 50% difference!
> Despite these factors, the company’s core business seems solid. They’re involved in materials that are increasingly important for lightweighting and durability in various industries. If they can continue to innovate and secure new contracts, that discount could start to shrink. It’s the kind of company that might not be flashy, but could offer steady returns if the market eventually recognizes its true worth.
> So, while the market might seem a bit shaky right now with all the global stuff going on, it actually opens doors for smart investors. It’s like Benjamin Graham said, markets can be a bit wild in the short run, but they tend to sort themselves out over time. We’ve looked at some tech companies that seem to be flying under the radar, maybe because of all the noise about trade or new tech like AI. But these companies have solid foundations. Don’t just chase what’s popular; sometimes the best opportunities are the ones that aren’t getting a lot of attention. Keep an eye on these undervalued players – they could be the ones that really pay off down the road.
> A tech stock is considered undervalued when its current stock price is lower than what its actual worth suggests. This can happen if the market is overlooking the company’s strong performance, future potential, or if there’s temporary bad news that doesn’t affect its long-term value. Think of it like finding a great toy on sale because the store had too many.
> Sometimes, the stock market gets worried about big issues like trade wars or new technologies like AI. This worry can make investors sell stocks, even good ones. It’s like everyone panics because of a rumor, and prices drop for a bit, creating a chance to buy if you believe the company is still strong.
> You can look at how much money the company is making (revenue) and how much profit it’s keeping (earnings). Companies that are growing well often see these numbers go up year after year. Also, check if they are making more cash than they spend, which is called free cash flow.
> A strong balance sheet means a company has more assets (things it owns) than debts (money it owes). It also means it has plenty of cash on hand. This shows the company is financially healthy and can handle tough times or invest in new projects.
> Geopolitical uncertainty refers to global events like conflicts or trade disputes. These can make markets jumpy. However, sometimes these uncertain times can make certain tech companies, especially those that are essential or less affected by global trade, seem like better deals because investors are focused elsewhere.
> Free cash flow (FCF) is the cash a company has left over after paying for its operations and investments. It’s like the money left in your pocket after buying all your school supplies. Investors like FCF because a company can use it to pay back debt, buy back its own stock, or invest in new growth, which can make the stock more valuable.

### 5. [Africa leads growth in solar energy as demand spreads beyond traditional markets, report says](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/africa-leads-growth-solar-energy-045704153.html)
**Source**: Yahoo Finance | **Date**: 2026-02-13T05:18:00+00:00

> NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — Africa was the world’s fastest-growing solar market in 2025, defying a global slowdown and reshaping where the momentum in renewable energy is concentrated, according to an industry report released in late last month.
> The report by the Africa Solar Industry Association says the continent's solar installed capacity expanded 17% in 2025, boosted by imports of Chinese-made solar panels. Global solar power capacity rose 23% in 2025 to 618 GW, slowing from a 44% increase in 2024.
> “Chinese companies are the main drivers in Africa’s green transition,” said Cynthia Angweya-Muhati, acting CEO of the Kenya Renewable Energy Association. “They are aggressively investing in and building robust supply chains in Africa green energy ecosystem.”
> Some of that capacity has yet to be rolled out. Africa has only 23.4 gigawatts peak (GWp) of working solar capacity even though nearly 64 GWp of solar equipment has been shipped to the continent since 2017. A gigawatt peak represents 1 billion watts of maximum, optimum power output under ideal conditions.
> “Africa's growth is driven by changing policies and enabling conditions in a number of countries, "said John Van Zuylen, CEO of the Africa Solar Industry Association.
> “Solar energy has moved beyond a handful of early adopters to become a broader continental priority,” he said recently on the sidelines of the Inter Solar Africa summit in Nairobi. “What we are seeing is not temporary. It is policies aligning with market dynamics.”
> Historically, South Africa dominated solar imports in Africa, at one point accounting for roughly half of all panels shipped to the continent. The latest data show its share has slipped below a third as demand surged elsewhere. Last year, 20 African nations set new annual records for solar imports, as 25 countries imported a total of at least 100 megawatts of capacity.
> Nigeria has overtaken Egypt as Africa's second-largest importer as solar energy and battery storage provide a practical and affordable alternative to diesel generators and unreliable grid power. In Algeria, solar imports soared more than 30-fold year-on-year. Imports also surged in Zambia and Botswana.
> At least 23 African countries, including South Africa, Tunisia, Kenya, Chad and the Central African Republic, are now generating over 5% of their electricity from solar energy, the report said.
> Prices have fallen both for solar panels and batteries, mostly from China, enabling households and businesses to rely on solar plus batteries for round-the-clock electricity, the report said. Battery storage costs in Africa fell to $112 per kilowatt-hour in 2025 from an average of $144 per kilowatt-hour in 2023 as improved technology made storage systems more flexible and longer lasting.
> “This ever-decreasing price of storage has game-changing implications for Africa, which has a dire need for stable and baseload power,” said Van Zuyken.
> The gradual removal of diesel subsidies in Nigeria in the past two years also has helped accelerate adoption of solar energy. The policy was implemented sector by sector to cushion its impact, making diesel increasingly expensive and nudging businesses and households toward solar. In September, Nigeria announced plans for a 1 GW solar panel factory, the largest in West Africa. Similar facilities are under construction in Egypt, South Africa and Ethiopia.
> As Africa moves to build its own manufacturing capacity, the industry is looking to China to transfer knowhow to help alleviate Africa’s dependence on imported equipment and technology.
> Jobs won't be confined to manufacturing.
> “The solar jobs boom is occurring in services including installation, maintenance, distribution and financing, where thousands of small and medium enterprises are emerging to meet rising demand,” Van Zuylen said.
> Unlike regions such as the Middle East, where governments publish clear 10 or 20-year energy roadmaps, many African markets lack consistent policy signals. So, uncertainty over policies remains a challenge. Solar firms operating across Africa say unpredictable tax regimes, shifting import duties and unclear long-term energy plans undermine investor confidence.
> “The problem is not the opportunity. It’s visibility,” said Amos Wemanya, senior analyst on renewable energy at Powershift Africa. “If a government announces a plan, companies need to trust that it will remain in place.”

## 📌 Topic: Oil Price Fluctuations and Geopolitical Risks
*(Found 5 articles)*

### 1. [Oil prices stable as investors weigh OPEC+ supply, US inflation data](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/13/oil-set-for-weekly-drop-as-iran-risks-recede-oversupply-concerns.html)
**Source**: CNBC | **Date**: 2026-02-13T18:38:00+00:00

> Oil prices held steady on Friday after data showed an overall slowdown in U.S. inflation, recovering from an earlier dip on news that OPEC+ is leaning towards a resumption in production increases.
> Brent crude futures gained 23 cents, or 0.34%, to close at $67.75 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude rose 5 cents, or 0.08%, to settle at $62.89 per barrel.
> Both oil benchmarks were headed for weekly declines after incurring near 3% losses on Thursday. Brent was headed for a 0.6% weekly loss, and WTI 1.2%.
> U.S. consumer prices increased less than expected in January amid cheaper gasoline and a moderation in rental inflation.
> "Looks like inflation is stabilizing. So, I think that's going to be a boon for interest rates to probably continue to move a little bit lower. And I think as as rates start to move lower... that's a positive to the economy," said Dennis Kissler, senior vice president of trading at BOK Financial.
> "The negative is going to be that OPEC could possibly increase production a little further," he added.
> Prices fell earlier in the session as investors reacted to a Reuters report that OPEC is leaning towards a resumption in oil output increases from April, ahead of upcoming peak summer fuel demand, and amid firmer crude prices owing to tensions over U.S.-Iran relations.
> Brent futures touched an intra-day low of $66.89 per barrel on the news, but then recovered.
> Oil prices had strengthened earlier in the week on concerns that the U.S. could attack Middle Eastern oil producer Iran over its nuclear programme. But comments on Thursday from U.S. President Donald Trump that Washington could make a deal with Iran over the next month drove down prices on Thursday.
> Away from the Middle East, Russia said on Friday that the next round of peace talks on Ukraine will take place next week.
> Negotiations with Iran and Russia will be the near-term market movers, Kissler said, adding that near-term global crude supplies remain ample and crude futures likely have a $5 to $7 per barrel geopolitical premium baked in.
> The U.S. also eased sanctions on Venezuela's energy sector on Friday, issuing two general licenses that allow global energy companies to operate oil and gas projects in the OPEC member and for other companies to negotiate contracts to bring in fresh investments.
> Oil sales from Venezuela controlled by the U.S. have totaled over $1 billion so far and in the next few months will bring in another $5 billion, U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright told NBC News on Thursday.

### 2. [Goldman Sachs Loves 5 Energy Stocks Offering Dividends and Big Growth Potential](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sachs-loves-5-energy-131345403.html)
**Source**: Yahoo Finance | **Date**: 2026-02-13T15:37:00+00:00

> Energy stocks have surged in 2026, driven by a confluence of favorable factors. Oil prices have remained elevated near $70 per barrel, as OPEC+ production discipline has tightened global supply while demand from Asia, particularly China and India, continues to recover and grow. Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and Eastern Europe have added risk premiums to crude prices. At the same time, natural gas markets have benefited from increased LNG export capacity and Europe's ongoing need to diversify away from Russian supplies.
> Goldman Sachs is positive on ten top stocks in the energy sector.
> Energy has outperformed the S&P 500 so far in 2026 and looks to continue that outperformance.
> Top energy companies pay dependable, and in some cases, large dividends.
> A recent study identified one single habit that doubled Americans’ retirement savings and moved retirement from dream, to reality. Read more here.
> The analysts at Goldman Sachs started to warm up to the energy sector last year, as it continued to underperform the overall market. The tables have turned, and energy is now outperforming the S&P 500 by a substantial margin. In their first-quarter Energy Portfolio Strategy report, they highlight ten leading companies across six sector silos that are top picks at Goldman Sachs. They said this in the report when discussing energy stocks and the sector as a whole:
> The repricing of Energy equities has been significant this year, with the XLE +23% vs the S&P +1%. The strength has been driven by positive GDP revisions, a broader tech rotation, as well as positive oil momentum amid smaller than expected surpluses and geopolitical uncertainty. We continue to value equities using a $70 Brent and $3.75 Henry Hub mid-cycle view. In this report, we discuss 10 ideas where we still see attractive total return, with ~19% average total return.
> We screened the top 10 stock picks for the greatest upside relative to Goldman Sachs' target prices and reliable dividend yields. In other words, we sought the top total-return candidates in the group. All are rated Buy at Goldman Sachs.
> Goldman Sachs is the acknowledged leader in the investment landscape on Wall Street and worldwide. The firm's top-notch research department continues to provide institutional and high-net-worth clients with the best ideas across the investment spectrum. It is likely to continue doing so for years.
> As the leading U.S. LNG exporter, with a small 0.94% dividend, Cheniere Energy Inc. (NYSE: LNG) is positioned to benefit from both domestic AI-driven demand and international energy needs. Natural gas accounts for 43% of U.S. electricity production, and Cheniere’s ability to scale operations quickly makes it a key player. The company’s export capabilities also provide a hedge against fluctuations in the domestic market. Some on Wall Street believe electricity demand growth could increase by as much as 160% by 2030.
> Cheniere Energy is a producer and exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in the United States. The Company provides clean and secure LNG to integrated energy companies, utilities, and energy trading companies worldwide. The company operates two natural gas liquefaction and export facilities: one at Sabine Pass, Louisiana (Sabine Pass LNG Terminal), and another near Corpus Christi, Texas (Corpus Christi LNG Terminal).
> The Sabine Pass LNG Terminal, which features natural gas liquefaction facilities comprising six operational trains, has a total production capacity of approximately 30 million tons per annum (mtpa) of LNG.
> The Corpus Christi LNG Terminal near Corpus Christi, Texas, consists of three trains for a total production capacity of approximately 15 mtpa of LNG, three LNG storage tanks, and two marine berths. It also owns and operates a 94-mile natural gas supply pipeline that interconnects the Sabine Pass LNG Terminal with several large interstate and intrastate pipelines.
> The Goldman Sachs price target for the shares is $275, representing a 25% gain.
> This company is one of the largest natural gas producers in the U.S. EQT Corp. (NYSE: EQT) has a 1.14% dividend, is particularly active in the Appalachian Basin, and is also noted for its low-cost production. It is a premier, vertically integrated American natural gas company with production and midstream operations focused on the Appalachian Basin. It has operations in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Ohio.
> Its strategic location in the Southeast, particularly near data center hubs such as Northern Virginia, makes it a key supplier of AI-driven energy services. EQT has secured agreements to supply natural gas to major data center campuses, including the redevelopment of a former coal plant in Homer City, Pennsylvania, into a natural-gas-powered data center.
> EQT owns or leases approximately 610,000 net acres in Pennsylvania. Most of the acreage is in the state's southwestern region, with the majority in Greene and Washington Counties. The company is developing the Marcellus Shale and Upper Devonian Shale in this area. It also owns or leases 405,000 net acres in West Virginia. Most of the acreage is located in the northwestern region of the state, with the majority located in Doddridge, Marion, Tyler, and Wetzel Counties.
> It owns or leases 65,000 net acres in eastern Ohio and is developing the Utica Shale in Belmont County. It operates Utica wells throughout its Ohio acreage. The Marcellus Shale lies at depths of 1 mile or more beneath the surface throughout much of Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, and West Virginia.
> One of our top 24/7 Wall St. writers conducted a thorough review of the EQT shares and explained in depth why they are a massive buy now.
> The Goldman Sachs price target is $66. Hitting the target would be a 16% gain.
> This is a new addition to the Goldman Sachs Conviction List and offers a 2.26% dividend and significant upside to the target price. Golar LNG Ltd. (NASDAQ: GLNG) designs, owns, and operates marine infrastructure for the liquefaction of natural gas and the regasification, storage, and offloading of liquefied natural gas (LNG). Its fleet comprises two floating liquefied natural gas vessels (FLNGs).
> The company’s segments include:
> The FLNG segment covers operations of FLNG vessels and projects. It converts LNG carriers into FLNG vessels, builds new ones, and contracts them to customers. This segment includes vessels such as FLNG Hilli, FLNG Gimi, and MKII FLNG.
> The Shipping segment focuses on the transportation operations of LNG carriers.
> The Corporate and Other segment includes administrative tasks, ship operations, and maintenance services. It also provides FLNG commercial, operational, and technical support; crew management services and supervision; and corporate secretarial, accounting, and treasury services.
> Goldman Sachs has set a $56 target price, representing a 27% gain from current levels.
> Viper Energy Inc. (NASDAQ: VNOM) owns and acquires mineral and royalty interests in oil and natural gas properties in the Permian Basin. With a 5.39% dividend yield, this mid-cap energy play offers significant upside relative to the Goldman Sachs target price. Viper Energy is an independent oil and natural gas company focused on the acquisition, development, exploration, and exploitation of unconventional, onshore oil and natural gas reserves, primarily in the Permian Basin in West Texas.
> The company primarily focuses on oil and natural gas properties in the Permian Basin, which covers approximately 75,000 square miles centered on Midland, Texas.
> The Viper Energy assets consist of mineral and royalty interests underlying 1,197,638 gross and 34,217 net royalty acres, primarily in the Permian Basin.
> It's estimated that proved oil and natural gas reserves totaled 179,249 thousand barrels of crude oil equivalent (MBOE). The company's proven undeveloped reserves include approximately 529 gross horizontal well locations. The company’s proved reserves include approximately 50% oil, 25% natural gas liquids, and 25% natural gas.
> A Goldman Sachs price target of $54 represents a stunning 23% gain from current levels.
> This utility giant will work in tandem with big tech to provide the power needed for data centers and cloud computing, and pays a small 0.56% dividend. Vistra Corp. (NYSE: VST) is an integrated retail electricity and power generation company that provides essential resources to customers, businesses, and communities from California to Maine.
> The company operates a reliable fleet of power-generation facilities, including natural gas, nuclear, coal, solar, and battery energy storage, while adopting an innovative, customer-centric approach to its retail business.
> The Retail segment sells electricity and natural gas to residential, commercial, and industrial customers.
> The Texas and East segments are engaged in electricity generation, wholesale energy sales and purchases, commodity risk management activities, fuel procurement, and logistics management.
> The West segment comprises results from the CAISO market, including battery ESS projects at the Moss Landing power plant site.
> The Asset Closure segment is engaged in decommissioning and reclaiming retired plants and mines.
> Goldman Sachs' price target for the shares is $205, representing a 28% gain.
> Most Americans drastically underestimate how much they need to retire and overestimate how prepared they are. But data shows that people with one habit have more than double the savings of those who don’t.
> And no, it’s got nothing to do with increasing your income, savings, clipping coupons, or even cutting back on your lifestyle. It’s much more straightforward (and powerful) than any of that. Frankly, it’s shocking more people don’t adopt the habit given how easy it is.

### 3. [Market Positioning Itself for Period of Higher Geopolitical Risk](https://www.rigzone.com/news/market_positioning_itself_for_period_of_higher_geopolitical_risk-13-feb-2026-182977-article/)
**Source**: Rigzone | **Date**: 2026-02-13T11:42:00+00:00

> The oil market is positioning itself for a period of higher geopolitical risk and unpredictability, according to Emily Ashford, Energy Research Head at Standard Chartered Bank.
> “This is evident in both the gradual push higher in flat price, adjustments in the forward curve and volatility skew,” Ashford said in a report sent to Rigzone by the Standard Chartered team this week.
> “Brent crude for April delivery settled at $69.04 per barrel on 9 February, a week on week rise of $2.74 per barrel (or 4.13 percent). The forward curve has moved higher week on week,” Ashford added.
> “While movement at the front of the curve is the most significant, even delivery in five years is $0.53 per barrel higher week on week,” Ashford continued.
> “Call skew is very well bid, with 1m risk reversal (RR) at 18.69 on 9 February; approximately the same levels as during the initial Russian invasion of Ukraine (19.14 on 8 March 2022) , and was only recently higher in mid-June 2025 (23.01 on 17 June 2025), during the previous escalation in the U.S.-Iran-Israel conflict,” the Standard Chartered Bank Energy Research Head went on to state.
> In the report, Ashford highlighted that traders and analysts were meeting in London this week for the annual International Energy Week, which the energy head said “is always a useful gauge of market sentiment”.
> “Last year the focus was around the new second Trump administration, and whether it would be inherently bullish or bearish for oil prices,” Ashford noted.
> “This was particularly so given the signing of a National Security Presidential Memorandum in early February 2025 that restored maximum pressure on Iran, with a focus on reducing its crude exports,” Ashford said.
> “One year later, and the complex U.S.-Iran relationship and potential impact on Iranian barrels in the market remains front and center,” Ashford continued.
> In the report, Ashford outlined that Standard Chartered’s “core view” on crude oil is that “market sentiment appears to be gradually turning more positive as the bearish oversupply narrative so prevalent in H2-2025 weakens, and traders turn their attention to a more positive H2-2026”.
> “The supply-glut estimates of the main market commentators are likely to be revised towards seasonal norms, and demand expectations are already being adjusted higher for 2026,” Ashford added.
> “We expect prices to mean revert to the low to mid $60s per barrel, with an uptick in volatility on both supply and demand risks,” Ashford said.
> The Standard Chartered report projected that the ICE Brent nearby future crude oil price will average $62.00 per barrel in the first quarter of this year, $63.00 per barrel in the second quarter, $64.00 per barrel in the third quarter, $64.50 per barrel in the fourth quarter, and $63.50 per barrel overall in 2026.
> In a BMI report sent to Rigzone by the Fitch Group on Friday, BMI analysts noted that Brent crude “has risen sharply over the last week as President Trump’s threats to attack Iran unless a nuclear deal is reached raised the geopolitical risk premia with the risk of military strikes potentially impacting global oil supply”.
> “Brent is 9.2 percent higher for the week at $69.94 per barrel on elevated geopolitical risk. Brent prices blew through resistance levels of $66.5 per barrel and are likely to pause near … $70 per barrel barring direct military action,” the analysts added.
> “Any disruption to supply would tilt fundamentals more towards a balanced view setting the stage for sustained price gains,” they continued.
> The BMI analysts went on to state that physical demand for crude “remains robust with severe weather in the northern hemisphere increasing demand for heating oil and power, adding additional upside pressures to prices over the week”.
> They added that they maintain their forecast for Brent to average of $67 per barrel in 2026, “down from $69 per barrel in 2025”.

### 4. ['Stability offers investment confidence as Qatar poised for further growth'](https://thepeninsulaqatar.com/article/13/02/2026/stability-offers-investment-confidence-as-qatar-poised-for-further-growth)
**Source**: The Peninsula Qatar | **Date**: 2026-02-13T07:04:00+00:00

> Doha: Qatar, with its diversified growth, robust institutions and forward-looking partnerships, stands out as a compelling destination for both domestic and international investors seeking resilience and long-term returns in a region navigating global uncertainties, according to the latest S&P Global Ratings report.
> Despite a landscape beset with geopolitical tension and oil-price fluctuations, Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) corporate and infrastructure credit profiles are forecast to remain stable through 2026, according to the report titled GCC Corporate and Infrastructure Outlook 2026: Stability Despite Uncertainty. The findings offer a grounded yet optimistic view for investors in Qatar’s expanding economy.
> S&P’s analysis shows that around two-thirds of rated GCC corporates and infrastructure issuers carry investment-grade credit ratings, with an overwhelming 97 percent maintaining stable outlooks.
> This stability narrative aligns well with Qatar’s broader economic trajectory. Standard Chartered and other financial institutions project robust GDP growth for Qatar in 2026, supported by robust liquefied natural gas (LNG) expansion and diversification efforts that extend beyond hydrocarbons into sectors such as finance, tourism, and trade.
> Qatar’s investment landscape is underpinned by strong macroeconomic fundamentals. Non-hydrocarbon sectors now contribute a majority of the nation’s GDP, reflecting successful diversification strategies. Public-private partnership (PPP) legislation and the expansion of financial services have further broadened the opportunities for both domestic and foreign investors.
> The country’s banking sector, for example, continues to exhibit strong capitalisation and liquidity, according to recent S&P Global Ratings assessments. This resilience supports corporate lending and private sector expansion, even as global market conditions remain uneven.
> Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund, the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), with approximately $580bn in assets under management, is actively enhancing investment partnerships with global financial institutions. A notable example is a new $25bn strategic investment agreement with Goldman Sachs, which aims to channel capital into cutting-edge sectors such as artificial intelligence, fintech, digital infrastructure, and private credit. This collaboration underscores Doha’s ambition to position itself as a regional financial hub while driving diversification beyond energy exports.
> Across the GCC, stable credit profiles and supportive funding conditions have created an enabling environment for infrastructure financing. S&P highlights that capital markets remain accessible, with rated Gulf firms raising significantly more funding in early 2026 than in the same period last year.
> In Qatar, this translates into opportunities in sectors such as transport, utilities, and digital infrastructure, fields that align with the national development agenda under Qatar National Vision 2030. The greater involvement of private capital, encouraged by PPP frameworks, is catalysing long-term investment in both social and economic infrastructure.
> However, risks persist. S&P’s baseline assumes limited credit impact from geopolitical tensions, but warns that severe disruptions, particularly in energy export routes, could affect financing conditions and economic performance.
> Qatar’s proactive reforms and infrastructure investments have helped maintain investor confidence even as global markets remain volatile. Real GDP per capita is projected to rise sharply by 2026, reflecting elevated productivity and progress toward higher-income status.
> The banking system’s stability, coupled with strong sovereign support for key sectors, continues to attract capital inflows.
> Enhanced regulatory frameworks and investment incentives, including tax exemptions and foreign ownership reforms, are also contributing to a more attractive investment climate.
> The GCC outlook affirms a period of credit stability rather than exuberant expansion, driven by steady economic growth, supportive government spending, and evolving infrastructure financing models.
> Doha: Qatar, with its diversified growth, robust institutions and forward-looking partnerships, stands out as a compelling destination for both domestic and international investors seeking resilience and long-term returns in a region navigating global uncertainties, according to the latest S&P Global Ratings report.

A notable example is a new $25bn strategic investment agreement with Goldman Sachs, which aims to channel capital into cutting-edge sectors such as artificial intelligence, fintech, digital infrastructure, and private credit. This collaboration underscores Doha’s ambition to position itself as a regional financial hub while driving diversification beyond energy exports.
> Across the GCC, stable credit profiles and supportive funding conditions have created an enabling environment for infrastructure financing. S&P highlights that capital markets remain accessible, with rated Gulf firms raising significantly more funding in early 2026 than in the same period last year.
> In Qatar, this translates into opportunities in sectors such as transport, utilities, and digital infrastructure, fields that align with the national development agenda under Qatar National Vision 2030. The greater involvement of private capital, encouraged by PPP frameworks, is catalysing long-term investment in both social and economic infrastructure.
> However, risks persist. S&P’s baseline assumes limited credit impact from geopolitical tensions, but warns that severe disruptions, particularly in energy export routes, could affect financing conditions and economic performance.
> Qatar’s proactive reforms and infrastructure investments have helped maintain investor confidence even as global markets remain volatile. Real GDP per capita is projected to rise sharply by 2026, reflecting elevated productivity and progress toward higher-income status.
> The banking system’s stability, coupled with strong sovereign support for key sectors, continues to attract capital inflows.
> Enhanced regulatory frameworks and investment incentives, including tax exemptions and foreign ownership reforms, are also contributing to a more attractive investment climate.
> The GCC outlook affirms a period of credit stability rather than exuberant expansion, driven by steady economic growth, supportive government spending, and evolving infrastructure financing models.

### 5. [The Gold Market Shock No One Saw Coming - Russia's Stunning Return To The U.S. Dollar](https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/the-gold-market-shock-no-one-saw-coming-russias-stunning-return-to-the-u-s-dollar-1579528)
**Source**: FX Empire | **Date**: 2026-02-13T18:41:00+00:00

> A geopolitical volte-face may be unfolding and the Gold market is responding with historic force.
> In what could mark one of the most dramatic pivots in modern monetary history, an internal Kremlin memo reviewed by Bloomberg outlines proposals for Russia to re-embrace the U.S dollar settlement system as part of a sweeping economic partnership with the Trump administration. For a nation that has championed de-dollarization and deepened ties with Beijing, the implications are profound.
> Markets have taken notice. Gold and Silver erased an eye-watering $1.4 trillion in market value in just 20 minutes on Thursday, before surging back toward the psychologically critical $5,000 an ounce mark within 24 hours. Volatility of this magnitude is no longer an anomaly – it is becoming the defining feature of 2026.
> At the heart of Moscow’s reported proposal lies a potential return to dollar settlements – even for energy exports. Such a reversal would send tremors through global finance.
> For years, the prevailing narrative has been one of accelerating de-dollarization. Yet the Kremlin’s seven-pillar “Grand Bargain” suggests the opposite: joint LNG and Oil ventures with U.S firms, cooperation on critical minerals such as Lithium, Copper and Platinum, preferential access for American brands, nuclear energy partnerships to power AI infrastructure and even aviation modernisation using U.S aircraft.
> If realized, this would represent a geopolitical masterstroke – trading confrontation for integration. But markets detest uncertainty and Gold thrives in it.
> “2026 has become the year of ‘Buy low, sell high – rinse and repeat,’” says Lars Hansen, Head of Research at The Gold & Silver Club. “The asymmetry of risk-reward is staggering. A single well-timed trade on Gold is now delivering what used to take months – sometimes years – to achieve, in a single day.”
> The numbers are breath-taking. In a matter of days, the yellow metal has delivered some of the largest one-day gains on record.
> A 21% drawdown dragged Gold to $4,400 an ounce just days ago, only for prices to reclaim $5,000 in a blistering 17% rebound in under 48 hours. Earlier in the month, single-session gains of 11% and 9% stunned even seasoned professionals.
> These are not routine fluctuations. They are structural re-pricings driven by macro forces colliding in real-time. “Corrections and rallies of this magnitude are rare,” Hansen notes. “But this is where fortunes are made.”
> A growing number of major Wall Street banks have begun referring to the current environment as a ‘Golden Age of Trading’ – a period defined by extraordinary volatility, compressed cycles and outsized opportunity for those positioned correctly.
> While Russia appears to be floating a dollar return, China is moving in the opposite direction.
> Beijing’s combined holdings of U.S Treasuries, Equities and Bonds have fallen to $1.56 trillion – near the lowest level in 14 years.
> Excluding Belgium-held custodial accounts, the figure drops to $1.16 trillion, the weakest since 2008. Official Treasury holdings stand at $682.6 billion, the lowest since October 2008.
> At the same time, Chinese leadership has openly encouraged Gold accumulation. As a result, retail and institutional demand has surged. Now reports suggest banks are being urged to reduce exposure to U.S assets.
> Liquidity is shifting. And when the world’s second-largest economy pivots away from the dollar, the reverberations are global.
> This divergence – Russia potentially returning to the U.S dollar, while China trims exposure – underscores a deeper truth: the global monetary order is fragmenting. Central banks are hedging geopolitical volatility not with rhetoric, but with bullion.
> “What we are witnessing is nothing short of a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,” Hansen argues. “Volatility equals opportunity. And right now, we have opportunity on top of opportunity.”
> For savvy traders, the message is clear. In markets this explosive, fortunes are not built by those who watch – they are built by those who act with precision, conviction and speed. 2026 is separating participants from spectators. It’s during times like these where generational wealth is forged.
> History will record this period as a defining chapter in modern financial markets. The only question is: will you read about it or will you profit from it?
> Phil Carr is co-founder and the Head of Trading at The Gold & Silver Club, an international Commodities Trading, Research and Data-Intelligence firm.

**Source**: Human Resources Online | **Date**: 2026-02-13T01:36:00+00:00

> Singapore’s Ministry of Manpower (MOM) has responded to Parliamentary queries on how the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) may reshape the country’s labour market, particularly for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and fresh graduates entering the workforce. The questions raised were as follows:
> On fresh graduate hiring and employability
> Responding to the first set, MOM said it is studying how AI adoption could either complement or substitute different groups of workers. While SMEs and multinational corporations (MNCs) operate in distinct contexts, with varying levels of resources and organisational capabilities, the ministry noted that AI’s impact depends more on the nature of business activities and job roles than firm size.
> As such, workforce transformation efforts are designed to support firms across the board. Programmes focus on job redesign and reskilling alongside AI adoption, with implementation partners tailoring support based on each company’s needs. Firms undertaking larger or more complex transformation projects may receive closer guidance.
> The ministry added that it remains committed to helping all workers stay relevant in an AI-enabled economy. For those displaced by technology, the Government will work with employers to facilitate transitions into new roles through reskilling and workforce transformation initiatives.
> On concerns about graduate employment, MOM said overall employment rates for fresh graduates from Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) have remained broadly stable over the past decade, with fluctuations largely driven by broader economic uncertainty, geopolitical developments, and changing career aspirations of graduates.
> To prepare graduates for the changing landscape, IHLs are collaborating with industry partners and sector agencies to update curricula with AI-related competencies, domain skills, and core capabilities such as critical thinking, creativity, and communication. Work-based learning opportunities, including the AI Apprenticeship Programme, aim to help students apply these skills in real-world settings.
> "While artificial intelligence, or AI, is reshaping the labour market, its specific impact on entry-level PMET jobs remains uncertain," said MOM.
> MOM also highlighted that IHLs are working closely with sector agencies and industry partners to keep their curriculum relevant to prepare graduates for the AI era. This is done through "integrating AI competencies, domain-specific training, and core skills like critical thinking, creativity, and communication."
> These efforts are complemented by work-based learning programmes like the AI Apprenticeship Programme, which provide opportunities to apply AI skills in real workplace settings.
> Students and fresh graduates are also given access to Education and Career Guidance services within IHLs, alongside career matching and coaching support from Workforce Singapore and NTUC’s Employment and Employability Institute.
> Finally, MOM shared, in response to heightened economic uncertainties in 2025, young graduates have the option to tap on the Graduate Industry Traineeships Programme as a means to gain industry-relevant experience and ease their transition into permanent roles.

### 2. [India's efforts to democratise AI to get big impetus at India AI Impact Summit](http://www.uniindia.com/news/business-economy/india-s-efforts-to-democratise-ai-to-get-big-impetus-at-india-ai-impact-summit/3739773.html)
**Source**: UNITED NEWS OF INDIA | **Date**: 2026-02-13T15:23:00+00:00

> New Delhi, Feb 13 (UNI) India has taken strong steps towards leveraging the power of artificial intelligence in different sectors such as finance, governance or public service, healthcare, agriculture, defense and so on in the last few years, and with the country playing host to the India-AI Impact Summit 2026, which is scheduled between Feb 16 - 20 in the national capital, the whole discussion is expected to enter a new level.  The government projections indicate that AI can add approximately USD 1.7 trillion to India's economy by 2035. It is supported by forerunner schemes such as 'IndiaAI Mission' consisting of a budget of Rs 10,371.92 core focusing on democratising computing power, developing indigenous Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), and fostering startups. This vision of democratising the AI-led growth is expected to get a big boost and a new direction at the 'India-AI Impact Summit 2026', the industry watchers say. The  India-AI Impact Summit is the first of its kind platform happening in global south, largely inspired by the 'Paris AI Action Summit (held in Feb 2025).' The Summit is envisioned as a pivotal global platform to shape a future-oriented agenda for inclusive, responsible, and impactful AI. It aims to move beyond high-level discussions and deliver tangible outcomes that can support economic growth, social development, and sustainable use of AI. India-AI Impact Summit 2026 has three main core pillars: (i)People, (ii) Planet, and (iii) Progress. Deliberations are scheduled to happen on employment and skilling, sustainable and energy-efficient AI, and economic as well as social development. The summit provides a platform for collective engagement, bringing together 15-20 heads of government, more than 50 international ministers, and over 100 global and Indian CXOs. Deliberations of this power-packed event are organised through Chakras, or Working around seven interconnected thematic areas. The most pressing one among these are 'Democratizing AI Resources Working Group.' India already comes in the first group of AI-ready nations with systematic progress across all five layers of AI architecture applications, models, chips, infrastructure, and energy. 'AI-ready nations' refer to countries with infrastructure, regulatory frameworks, skills, and strategic vision necessary to effectively adopt and govern artificial intelligence. Besides this, India also performed great in Stanford University's 2025 Global AI Vibrancy Index by ranking in the 'third' position just behind developed economies like the US and China. In the IMF's AI Preparedness Index, India achieved a score of 49.3, which is much higher than 42.1 an average for emerging economies. These achievements are the fruits of policy frameworks and the tech-centric approach of the government. As highlighted earlier, the Centre has taken numerous steps towards democratising AI throughout the masses. It spans across public impact, AI infrastructure, access to compute, access to datasets and models, access to chips and semiconductor capabilities, and others. Now, there are advanced AI applications such as Bhasini, which enables language access through AI, MausamGPT for forecasting rainfall, fog, and extreme weather, and Kisan e Mitra for simplifying access to government schemes. Access to high-quality datasets is key to achieving democratisation, and thankfully, we have 'AIKosh', a national platform for AI datasets and models. As per the data of Feb, AIkosh brings together 7,541 datasets and 273 AI models spanning 20 sectors on a single national platform. Limited access to computing power is also hindering the process of AI democratisation. To clear this roadblock, the government has introduced some subsidised and shared compute resources. Under the IndiaAI Mission, more than 38,000 high-end Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have been onboarded and are available at Rs 65 per hour (nearly one-third of the global average cost). Additionally, 1,050 Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) have also been onboarded to further expand access to advanced AI processing capabilities. India is also strengthening its domestic chip capabilities with schemes like India Semiconductor Mission (ISM), which has an outlay of Rs 76,000 crore aimed to support manufacturing, design, and talent development. This mass spectrum of artificial intelligence in India also creates employment opportunities for the country and addresses the concerns of skill gaps among youths. NITI AAYOG, a premier think tank, highlighted in its report 'The Opportunity for Accelerated Economic Growth'  that one of the key potential outcomes of AI-led value creation is India's ability to progressively narrow the AI skill gap with leading countries by 2035. Even in India itself, job postings require AI expertise driven by the country's IT capital Bangalore (11 per cent share of AI jobs), Hyderabad (9.57 per cent share of AI jobs), Pune (6.95 per cent), and Chennai (6.62 per cent). To tackle these cross-sectoral AI demands, the 'India-AI Impact Summit 2026'  can be a great opportunity to expand footprints in global technology galore. The key seven Chakras of this summit:- (i) Human Capital, (ii) Inclusion for Social Empowerment, (iii) Safe and Trusted AI, (iv) Science, (v) Resilience, Innovation and Efficiency, (vi) Democratising AI resources, (vii) AI for Economic Development and Social Good. Each of the chakras aims to foster multilateral collaboration on societal impacts of artificial intelligence. It focuses on building skills to ensure ethical deployments. Overall, India currently stands at a pivotal stage for the democratisation of technology. This summit is a key enabler for the country to ensure access, inclusion, and equity at scale. The future path is clear and India's approach to AI democratisation highlights that scale, inclusion and innovation can work together. World is looking towards India as a role model in boosting the reach of AI to farmers, students, researchers, startups and public institutions. UNI SAS  KK

> Supported by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Government of India, the conclave will bring together senior representatives from the Union and State Governments, global policymakers, industry leaders, economists, academic experts and social sector practitioners. Discussions will focus on aligning artificial intelligence with the goals of equity, livelihood security and inclusive economic growth.
> As AI rapidly reshapes productivity, service delivery and business models, the conclave will examine emerging risks around concentration of capital, compute infrastructure and intellectual property, and their potential to deepen structural inequalities. Deliberations will explore policy and market interventions required to ensure equitable access to AI through infrastructure development, responsible data governance and inclusive skilling frameworks.
> Key agenda areas include AI inequality in global development, governance frameworks for responsible AI deployment, formalisation pathways for MSMEs and informal workers, and the role of digital public infrastructure in expanding access to AI systems. Special emphasis will be placed on enabling participation of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, women entrepreneurs, gig workers, sanitation workers, artisans and first-generation business owners in emerging AI value chains.
> A key outcome of the conclave will be the Delhi Declaration on Inclusive AI and the Future of Work, which is expected to outline national principles for equity-by-design, worker transition frameworks, portable social protection mechanisms, multilingual AI skilling pathways, inclusive data governance standards and strengthened Centre-State coordination. The Declaration will inform deliberations at the India AI Impact Summit 2026.
> Dr. Milind Kamble, Founder Chairman, DICCI & Conclave Chairman, Conclave on AI for Inclusion and the Future of Work stated, “Artificial intelligence will define the next phase of economic expansion. The central question is whether this growth will remain concentrated or become participatory. This conclave is anchored in six pillars — education, small business formalisation, financial literacy, future-ready agriculture, AI for speedy justice, and AI for empowering informal workers. Inclusion must be embedded at the design stage of AI systems and governance frameworks to ensure durable social mobility.”
> Padma Shri awardee Mr. Ravi Kumar Narra, National President, DICCI, added, “Economic empowerment delivers impact when policy intent is matched with institutional execution. AI must be deployed with similar discipline to enhance productivity in the informal economy, expand market access for small enterprises and enable credible worker transition pathways. Inclusion must be measurable, not aspirational.”
> Through this conclave, DICCI aims to institutionalise inclusion as a foundational principle within India’s evolving AI policy ecosystem, advancing structured dialogue and actionable commitments that align artificial intelligence with equity, employment and national development priorities.

### 5. [UN chief to attend AI Impact Summit 2026 in New Delhi, over 30 UN events planned](https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2026/Feb/13/un-chief-to-attend-ai-impact-summit-2026-in-new-delhi-over-30-un-events-planned)
**Source**: The New Indian Express | **Date**: 2026-02-13T16:32:00+00:00

> Senior United Nations leaders, including Secretary-General António Guterres, will participate in the AI Impact Summit 2026 in New Delhi from February 16 to 20, marking the first global artificial intelligence gathering of its scale to be hosted in the Global South.
> Organised by India’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, the Summit aims to bring together governments, international organisations, industry, academia and civil society to advance the responsible development and deployment of artificial intelligence in support of sustainable development goals.
> The UN system will convene more than 30 side events during the five-day Summit, focusing on themes such as agriculture and food security, gender equality, health systems, digital public infrastructure, disaster risk reduction and children’s safety.
> Ahead of his visit to India, Guterres underscored the need for global cooperation on AI governance. “We need shared understandings to build effective guardrails, unlock innovation for the common good, and foster cooperation,” he said.
> The Secretary-General will be joined by several senior UN and international leaders, including Volker Türk, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights; Amandeep Singh Gill, Under-Secretary-General and Special Envoy for Digital and Emerging Technologies; Kristalina Georgieva, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund; Gilbert F. Houngbo, Director-General of the International Labour Organization; Doreen Bogdan-Martin, Secretary-General of the International Telecommunication Union; and Kamal Kishore, the Secretary-General’s Special Representative for Disaster Risk Reduction.
> Senior representatives from UNDP, UN Women, UNESCO, UNICEF, UNFPA, FAO, the World Intellectual Property Organization and the UNICRI are also expected to participate.
> The Summit follows a major development at the UN, with the General Assembly appointing 40 members to the Independent International Scientific Panel on Artificial Intelligence, recommended by the Secretary-General. The panel, the first global scientific body of its kind on AI, will assess how artificial intelligence is transforming societies and economies worldwide.
> Selected from more than 2,600 candidates, the panel members will serve in their personal capacity and issue an annual report providing evidence-based assessments of AI’s opportunities, risks and impacts, including contributions to the new Global Dialogue on AI Governance. The panel includes Indian expert Balaraman Ravindran of IIT Madras.
> The Union government’s recent Budget announcements underline India’s broader push to integrate artificial intelligence across education, skills and emerging industries.
> Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s announcement in the Union Budget 2026–27, on introducing artificial intelligence (AI) in education is not the Centre’s first attempt to embed emerging technologies into the learning ecosystem. In the Union Budget 2025–26, the government had allocated Rs 500 crore for setting up a Centre of Excellence for the purpose.
> In the Budget 2026 speech  Sitharaman mentioned “artificial intelligence” a record 11 times, the highest frequency the term has appeared in any Indian Budget speech.
> The Budget outlined AI’s role across multiple domains, including governance, where it was described as a force multiplier for improving public service delivery, and the adoption of new technologies through initiatives such as the AI Mission and the National Quantum Mission.
> AI was also highlighted as a tool for labour market analysis to assess the impact of emerging technologies on job roles and skill requirements. The Budget announced Bharat-VISTAAR, a new multilingual AI tool aimed at improving linguistic accessibility.
> In agriculture, AI integration was proposed through AgriStack portals and ICAR agricultural practice packages. In healthcare and accessibility, the focus was on research and the integration of AI into assistive devices for persons with disabilities manufactured by the Artificial Limbs Manufacturing Corporation of India.
> The Budget also flagged the use of AI in customs and security through expanded non-intrusive scanning and advanced imaging for risk assessment. In education, it proposed embedding AI modules into the national curriculum from the school level onwards, alongside teacher training.
> Professional upskilling and reskilling programmes for engineers and technology professionals were outlined, along with plans to deploy AI-enabled platforms to better match workers with jobs and training opportunities.
> Over the past five years, the Union government has been working to promote AI across sectors, with a growing emphasis on integrating AI and other emerging technologies into curricula, supported by the large-scale rollout of e-content labs. Even as the government earmarked Rs 100 crore for AI in the education sector this year, the 2023 Budget had provided for the establishment of three Centres of Excellence in AI for agriculture, healthcare and sustainable cities.

**Source**: The Guardian | **Date**: 2026-02-13T16:32:00+00:00

> German chancellor rebuts idea of American unilateralism and says ‘democracies have partners and allies’
> The US acting alone has reached the limits of its power and may already have lost its role as global leader, Friedrich Merz, the German chancellor, warned Donald Trump at the opening of the Munich Security Conference.
> Merz also disclosed he had held initial talks with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, over the possibility of joining France’s nuclear umbrella, underlining his call for Europe to develop a stronger self-standing security strategy.
> In a speech on Friday designed to set a firm yet conciliatory tone about the future of the transatlantic partnership, Merz argued the old order had ended and in this new age of superpowers even the US was reaching the limits of going it alone.
> Referring to those that warned the international rules-based order was about to be destroyed, Merz said: “I fear we must put it even more bluntly. This order, however imperfect it was even at its best, no longer exists in that form.”
> Switching to English to ram home his message, Merz said: “In the era of great power rivalry, even the United States will not be powerful enough to go it alone. Dear friends, being a part of Nato is not only Europe’s competitive advantage. It is also the United States’ competitive advantage.”
> “So let’s repair and revive transatlantic trust together,” he added.
> The German chancellor’s speech opened the annual gathering of top global security figures including many European leaders and the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio.
> At last year’s conference, held a few weeks into Trump’s second term, the US vice-president, JD Vance, stunned European leaders by lecturing them about the state of democracy and freedom of speech on the continent – a moment that set the tone for the last year.
> A series of statements and moves from the Trump administration targeting allies has followed, including Trump’s threat last month to impose new tariffs on several European countries in a move to secure US control of Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark, a Nato ally.
> Merz drew most applause from an audience brimming with hostility toward US unilateralism when he directly criticised the current American administration, saying: “The culture war of the Maga movement is not ours. Freedom of speech ends here with us when that speech is directed against human dignity and the basic law. We do not believe in tariffs and protectionism, but in free trade. We stand by climate agreements and the World Health Organization.”
> “In the age of great powers, our freedom is no longer a given. It is threatened,” he said, adding that “firmness and willpower will be needed to assert this freedom”. Challenging Trump’s unilateral style, Merz added: “Autocracies may have followers, democracies have partners and allies.”
> At the same time, he said Europe must cast off its excessive dependence on the US, emphasising: “We won’t do that by writing off Nato.”
> He also urged the US president to recognise it was still possible to exhaust Russia economically and militarily, to the point where it was willing to come to the negotiating table over Ukraine.
> With Germany one of the European countries doing the most to boost its own defence spending, Merz clearly felt in a strong enough position to insist the US needed to do more to listen to European concerns about its security and the legitimacy of a sustained European pillar of Nato.
> Describing the Munich conference as a seismograph for the state of US-European relations, he said the Ukraine war “had forced Europe to return from a vacation from world history. Together we have entered an era that is once again marked by power and big-power politics.”
> These big powers, Merz said, “make their own rules. It is fast, harsh and often unpredictable. These powers exploit natural resources, technologies and supply chains using them as bargaining tools.”
> Merz was speaking as the fourth anniversary of the Russian invasion of Ukraine approaches and one year after Vance used his speech in the same hall to criticise Europeans for not taking enough control of their own defence arrangements and ignoring the demands of their electorates.
> Merz responded by saying it was crucial for the continent to change its mindset and fully exploit the “enormous” military, political, economic and technological potential of a “sovereign Europe”. Germany was striving for “partnership-based leadership” in Europe but retained no “hegemonic fantasies”.
> Merz said he had begun talks with Macron about a European nuclear deterrent. This, he said, must be firmly integrated into Nato’s nuclear arsenal and would not result in some parts of Europe being more defended than others. The chancellor stated that Germany was not abandoning Nato but wanted to establish a “strong, self-sustaining pillar” within the alliance.
> In his speech Macron insisted Europe must be at the table to negotiate a new arms control settlement with Russia covering ballistic missiles, deep strike capacity, defence technology and nuclear weapons.
> The French president said previous arms control treaties such as the now defunct INF Treaty were negotiated only by the US and this could not be repeated if Europe was to be taken seriously as a geopolitical power.
> He said initial talks about new European security architecture had already been held with the UK and Germany, but it was now time to broaden the consultations across Europe.
> Macron warned a Ukrainian peace settlement required applying extra pressure, but even if an agreement was reached Europe faced the challenge of how to “coexist with an unreconstructed aggressive Russia on our borders” that has “a bloated army and a defence industry on a sugar high”.
> Calling for a transparent independent European channel of communication with Russia, he said the post second world war security architecture had been “totally designed and framed during the cold war times” and needed a new articulation.
> Addressing the criticisms directed at Europe last year by Vance, Macron said “Europe has been vilified … as a repressive continent where speech is not free and where alternative facts cannot claim the same right of citizenship as truth itself – that outdated and cumbersome concept.”

> MUNICH (AP) — German Chancellor Friedrich Merz called on Friday for the United States and Europe to “repair and revive trans-Atlantic trust together,” saying that even the U.S. isn’t powerful enough to go it alone in an world whose old order has withered.
> Merz called for a “new trans-Atlantic partnership,” acknowledging that “a divide, a deep rift” has opened up across the Atlantic as he opened the Munich Security Conference, an annual gathering of top global security figures, including many European leaders and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Merz said that the post-World War II world order, “as imperfect as it was at its best times, no longer exists” today.
> Hours later, French President Emmanuel Macron said that “Europe has to become a geopolitical power.” He said that “it’s ongoing, but we have to accelerate” in areas such as defense, technology and “derisking vis-a-vis all the big powers in order to be much more independent.”
> At last year’s conference, a few weeks into U.S. President Donald Trump’s second term, U.S. Vice President JD Vance stunned European leaders by lecturing them about the state of democracy and freedom of speech on the continent — a moment that set the tone for the last year.
> A series of statements and moves from the Trump administration targeting allies followed, including Trump’s threat last month to impose new tariffs on several European countries in a bid to secure U.S. control of Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark. The president later dropped that threat.
> “The culture war of the MAGA movement in the U.S. is not ours,” Merz said. “The freedom of the word ends here when this word is turned against human dignity and the constitution. And we don’t believe in tariffs and protectionism, but in free trade.”
> He said that Europe would stand by climate agreements and the World Health Organization.
> But Merz said that Europe and the U.S. should conclude that “we are stronger together” in today’s world.
> “In the era of great-power rivalry, even the United States will not be powerful enough to go it alone,” he said. “Dear friends, being a part of NATO is not only Europe’s competitive advantage. It’s also the United States’ competitive advantage, so let’s repair and revive trans-Atlantic trust together.”
> The Europeans, Merz said, are doing their part.
> Since last year’s Munich conference, NATO allies have agreed under pressure from Trump to a large increase in their defense spending target.
> NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said that there has been a “shift in mindset,” with “Europe really stepping up, Europe taking more of a leadership role within NATO, Europe also taking more care of its own defense.”
> With Rubio heading the U.S. delegation this year, European leaders can hope for a less contentious approach more focused on traditional global security concerns. Before departing for Germany, Rubio had some reassuring words as he described Europe as important for Americans.
> “We’re very tightly linked together with Europe,” he told reporters. “Most people in this country can trace both, either their cultural or their personal heritage, back to Europe. So, we just have to talk about that.”
> But Rubio made clear that it wouldn’t be business as usual, saying: “We live in a new era in geopolitics, and it’s going to require all of us to reexamine what that looks like.”
> Mike Waltz, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told the conference that the U.S. had been sustaining the financial burden of multilateralism for too long and Europeans need to do more.
> “There is a cost to the status quo and the status quo was not sustainable any more,” Waltz said.
> Merz said that Europe’s “excessive dependency” on the U.S. was its own fault, but it’s leaving that behind.
> “We won’t do this by writing off NATO — we will do it by building a strong, self-supporting European pillar in the alliance, in our own interest,” he said.
> He acknowledged that Europe and the U.S. will likely have to bridge more disagreements in the future than in the past, but “if we do this with new strength, respect and self-respect, that is to the advantage of both sides.”
> Macron, who emphasized the priority of supporting Ukraine and called for greater regulation of social media, also stressed the importance of respect.
> “This is the right time for a strong Europe,” he said. “This Europe will be a good ally and partner for the United States of America, because it will be a partner taking its fair share of the burden. It will be a partner being respected — and we have to be respected.”
> Rubio arrived in Munich on Friday. He met with Merz, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and others separately on the sidelines of the conference. He is due to address the conference on Saturday morning.
> The German chancellor, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and several other European leaders met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Munich, before another round of U.S-brokered talks between envoys from Russia and Ukraine in Geneva next week.
> Rubio wasn’t participating in the meeting as his schedule was packed with separate bilateral meetings with European officials, including one with the leaders of Denmark and Greenland, a U.S. official said. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because neither the meeting nor Rubio’s attendance had been announced, said that Rubio was and would be discussing Russia’s war with Ukraine in other formats.
> Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha‎ played down the fact that Rubio didn’t attend the meeting, saying that, from Ukraine’s perspective, the important meeting with the Secretary of State would take place on Saturday.
> Sybiha‎ said security guarantees from the U.S. for Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire were “almost ready,” and that Ukraine had more clarity on what the U.S. was ready to provide following meetings in Abu Dhabi.
> He declined to give details of the guarantees but said they must be legally binding and include “intelligence data, of course, support in air, and other important elements which could be provided only by the USA.”
> When asked by AP if discussions had taken place over what the U.S. would do about a physical or hybrid attack by Russia in the event of a ceasefire, Sybiha said the U.S. and Ukraine “probably have this understanding,” without elaborating.

### 3. [German chancellor Merz suggests US has 'squandered' its claim to world leadership under Trump](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/german-chancellor-merz-suggests-us-154236715.html)
**Source**: Yahoo News UK | **Date**: 2026-02-13T15:41:00+00:00

> Germany’s chancellor Friedrich Merz has declared the international order is being destroyed, in a swipe at US president Donald Trump and his disruptive foreign policy.
> Speaking at the Munich Security Conference on Friday, Merz warned that the United States’ “claim to leadership is disputed, perhaps squandered”.
> “A rift has opened up between Europe and the United States. Vice President JD Vance said this very openly here in Munich a year ago,” Merz said, referring to Vance’s deeply contentious speech in which he lambasted traditional allies in Europe.
> “He was right. The culture war of the Maga movement is not ours. Freedom of speech ends here with us when that speech goes against human dignity and the constitution. We do not believe in tariffs and protectionism, but in free trade.”
> Referring to the upending of a rules-based order since Trump returned to office just over a year ago, the German leader gave a bleak assessment of the current climate.
> “You’ve chosen a grim motto for this conference, ‘under destruction’, and it probably means that the international order based on rights and rules is currently being destroyed,” he told the summit.
> “But I’m afraid we have to put it in even harsher terms: This order, as flawed as it has been even in its heyday, no longer exists.”
> This year alone, Trump has deposed the leader of Venezuela with a military strike, threatened Greenland with annexation and sent aircraft carriers to the Middle East amid ongoing tensions with Iran.
> However, Merz did offer an olive branch to the United States, represented at the three-day summit by secretary of state Marco Rubio.
> “In the era of great power rivalry, even the United States will not be powerful enough to go it alone,” Merz continued, referring to the rise of China, and Russia’s geopolitical aims.
> “Dear friends, being a part of Nato is not only Europe’s competitive advantage. It is also the United States’ competitive advantage. So let’s repair and revive transatlantic trust together,” he said.
> Merz went on to reiterate the importance of bolstering Nato’s defences and expressed Germany’s commitment to investing billions in the partnership in the coming years.
> Europe has been left reeling from Trump’s more aggressive foreign policy in his second term, forcing a reassessment of global alliances. The theme is expected to come up repeatedly during the Munich conference, though Trump himself is not attending.
> “No one in Europe, or in the United States, wins from any kind of conflict between old allies,” said Danish prime minister Mette Frederiksen on Friday, reiterating Merz’s commitment to retain a good relationship with the U.S.
> “So we must do what we can to keep the Americans close to us, but this is a new world disorder that we live in.”

**Source**: RTÉ Ireland | **Date**: 2026-02-13T18:49:00+00:00

> German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has said that Berlin had begun confidential talks with France about a European nuclear deterrent, saying the region had to ⁠become stronger in order to reset its relationship with the United States.
> In a speech to open the Munich Security Conference, Mr Merz also called on Washington to "repair and revive trust" in a dangerous new era of great power politics, warning the US could not go it alone as the old global order crumbles.
> The speech underscored how European leaders are increasingly looking to carve an independent path after a year of unprecedented upheaval in transatlantic ties, while also striving to maintain their alliance with Washington.
> Europe faces myriad threats from Russia's war in Ukraine to massive ructions in global trade.
> "I have begun confidential talks with the French President on European nuclear deterrence," Mr Merz said. "We Germans are adhering to our legal obligations. We see this as strictly embedded within our nuclear sharing in NATO. And we will not allow zones of differing security to emerge in Europe."
> French President Emmanuel Macron is due to make a speech on the nuclear deterrent later this month. Officials have remained guarded on the issue given it is the president's prerogative.
> European nations have long relied heavily on the United States, including its large nuclear arsenal, for ‌their defence but have been increasing military spending, partly in response to ⁠sharp criticism from the Trump administration.
> While Germany is currently banned from developing a nuclear weapon under international agreements, France is the European Union's only nuclear power following Britain's departure from the bloc and has the world's fourth-largest stockpile.
> Taking his cue from those warning that the international rules-based order was about to be destroyed, Mr Merz said: "I fear we must put it even more bluntly: This order, however imperfect it was even at its best, no longer exists in that form."
> Switching to English at the end, Mr Merz said: "In the era of great power rivalry, even the United States will not be powerful enough to go it alone. Dear friends, being a part of NATO is not only Europe's ‌competitive advantage. It is also the United States' competitive advantage."
> "So let’s repair and revive transatlantic trust together," he added.
> US Secretary of State Marco Rubio had also said transatlantic ties faced a "defining moment" in a rapidly changing world but struck a more conciliatory tone ⁠that contrasted with remarks by Vice President JD Vance in 2025.
> At the same gathering of top security officials last year, Mr Vance had attacked European allies in a speech that marked the start of a ‌series of confrontations.
> "I think it's at a defining moment ... the world is changing very fast right in front of us," Mr Rubio said before departing ⁠for Munich.
> "(The US is) deeply ‌tied to Europe, and our futures have always been linked and will continue to be," said Mr Rubio, who is a potential rival to Vance for the 2028 US presidential race. "So we've just got to talk about what that future looks like."

> Transatlantic ties have long been central to the Munich Security Conference, which began as a Cold War forum for Western defence debate. But the unquestioned assumption of cooperation that underpinned it has been upended.
> Underscoring the damage, a YouGov poll ⁠of the six largest European countries showed favourability towards the US in Europe hitting its lowest since tracking began in 2016.
> The latest figures are broadly comparable to – and in some cases higher than – the perceived threat from ⁠China, Iran or North Korea, although behind Russia, YouGov said.
> US President Donald Trump has toppled Venezuela’s leader, threatened other Latin American countries with similar military action, imposed tariffs on friends and foes alike and talked openly about annexing Greenland from fellow NATO member Denmark - a move that could effectively end the alliance.
> Last year's speech by Mr Vance accused European leaders of censoring free speech and failing to control immigration, which Mr Merz explicitly rejected.
> "A rift has opened up between Europe and the United States. Vice President JD Vance said this very openly here in Munich a year ago," Mr Merz said.
> "He was right. The culture war of the MAGA movement is not ours. Freedom of speech ends here with us when that speech goes against human dignity and the constitution. We do not believe in tariffs and protectionism, but in ‌free trade," he said, drawing applause.
> 'Constructive’ meeting held over Greenland
> Denmark's prime minister has said she and her Greenlandic counterpart had a constructive meeting with Mr Rubio at the conference over the semi-autonomous Danish territory.
> A push by Mr Trump for the US to acquire Greenland prompted severe tensions in recent months within NATO, of which Denmark and the US are both members.
> On 28 January, the US, ‌Denmark and the Arctic ⁠island nation launched talks as the parties seek to resolve the diplomatic crisis.
> "Constructive talk with Secretary of State Marco Rubio together with Jens-Frederik Nielsen, Chairman of Naalakkersuisut, at the Munich Security Conference," Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said. "Work will continue as agreed in the high-level ‌working group.
> Mr Nielsen said on Instagram Greenland's interests were "again clearly highlighted" in the meeting. "It was emphasised that the ⁠talks being held are the right way forward," he said.
> He has ‌previously stated that if Greenlanders were forced to choose between the ⁠US and ‌Denmark, they would choose Denmark.
> Mr Trump has been citing national security concerns related to Russia and China in connection with his repeated calls for US control over Greenland. NATO this week ⁠announced the launch of a mission to strengthen its presence in the Arctic as part of ⁠efforts to defuse tensions.
> The president told reporters at the White House: "I think Greenland's going to want us, but we get along very well with Europe. We'll see how it all works out. We're negotiating right now for Greenland".

### 5. [Germany's Merz blasts 'lost' US leadership and says global order 'no longer exists'](https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-firedrich-merz-blasts-lost-us-leadership-as-international-order-no-longer-exists/)
**Source**: Politico Europe | **Date**: 2026-02-13T19:09:00+00:00

> MUNICH, Germany — German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said that U.S. leadership can no longer be taken for granted and Europe must prepare to stand more firmly on its own, in a stark warning to world leaders in Munich.
> “The leadership claim of the U.S. is being challenged, perhaps already lost,” Merz said during the opening of the Munich Security Conference, laying out the starkest assessment yet from Berlin of a world increasingly defined by great-power rivalry. “In the era of great powers, our freedom is no longer simply guaranteed. It is under threat.”
> He argued the global system itself may already have collapsed. “The international order based on rights and rules … no longer exists in the way it once did,” he said.
> Merz also drew a lesson from Germany’s own history. “We Germans know a world in which might makes right would be a dark place,” he said. “Our country has gone down this path in the 20th century until the bitter and dreadful end.”
> Most strikingly, the chancellor confirmed discussions with French President Emmanuel Macron about a European nuclear deterrent.
> The speech amounted to a strategic repositioning of Germany: still anchored in NATO, but preparing for a future in which American guarantees are less reliable and Europe must carry more responsibility.
> That message echoed remarks earlier in Munich from U.S. Deputy Defense Secretary Elbridge Colby, who called for a “NATO 3.0” in which European allies assume a far greater share of defense burdens while Washington prioritizes other theaters.
> The United States wants “vigorous, capable, more self-reliant European allies,” Colby said, adding America had long carried a “vastly disproportionate share” of the burden. He singled out Germany for special praise for its “historic, tremendous shift” in defense spending.
> Merz signaled Berlin is already preparing for a scenario with a smaller American footprint in Europe, and that Germany may at times diverge from the U.S. “We Europeans are taking precautions. In doing so, we arrive at different conclusions than the administration in Washington,” he said.
> How far France will go to reassure its allies that they would be protected by its nuclear weapons is one of the most sensitive questions in Europe’s security architecture.
> “I spoke with Emmanuel Macron about a European nuclear deterrence,” Merz said, suggesting Germany is openly considering alternatives amid uncertainty about long-term U.S. protection.
> The debate reflects fears across Europe about whether the American nuclear umbrella would protect the continent in a crisis — a concern increasingly voiced by policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic.
> Merz also underscored growing political and economic divergence with Washington, referencing ideological and trade disputes linked to Donald Trump’s policies.
> “A deep divide has opened between Europe and the United States,” he said. “The culture wars of the U.S. are not ours. And we do not believe in tariffs and protectionism, but in free trade.”
> The remarks signaled that tensions are no longer confined to burden-sharing in NATO but extend to economic policy and democratic norms.
> Merz paired his warnings about the United States with a hardening stance toward Beijing ahead of a planned visit to China later this month. He warned China could soon rival American military power and accused it of exploiting economic dependencies — citing rare-earth export controls that disrupted German industry.
> The message: European autonomy will not mean alignment with China.
> Throughout the speech, Merz returned to a central theme — Europe is entering a harsher geopolitical era shaped by Russia’s war in Ukraine and the rise of major powers unconstrained by old international norms.
> He also reiterated Germany's long-term support for Ukraine. “This war will only end when Russia is at least economically, potentially militarily, exhausted,” he said.
> He praised European solidarity, including support for Greenland’s sovereignty after Trump's political pressure to annex the Danish territory, framing unity as Europe’s main strategic asset.
> “This does not mean we accept this reality as fate,” Merz said. “We are not helpless in this world. We will open new doors and seize new opportunities.”
