> The job market is showing signs of stability. Now, if the Federal Reserve can only get inflation under control.
> Employers added 130,000 jobs in January, surprising economists. But some Fed officials this week said their focus remains on elevated prices as the central bank looks at whether more interest rate cuts are needed for the economy. The comments come ahead of this Friday’s release of January inflation data, following the December report that showed annual price increases of 2.7% remained well above the Fed’s target.
> “We must remain focused on our headline inflation objective; otherwise, I believe there is a real risk that inflation will get stuck closer to 3% than 2% in the long run,” said Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid in a statement.
> But just because the job market is strong doesn’t mean that there isn’t more room to cut interest rates, Fed Governor Stephen Miran told Fox Business after Wednesday's jobs numbers were released.
> Miran has pushed for larger interest rate cuts since President Donald Trump appointed him to fill a vacancy at the Fed last year. He said on Wednesday that fewer regulatory burdens on the U.S. economy would help it produce more, which would lower prices and give the Fed the opportunity to further cut rates.
> If the Federal Reserve holds interest rates at their current levels, that will keep borrowing costs higher for longer. That has the potential to affect everything from mortgage and credit card rates to stock valuations, since the expectation of future rate cuts often drives market moves.
> “I view there being a variety of reasons to why I want to see lower interest rates,” Miran said. “While today’s job data made me feel really good about the economy, I think the truth is that pushing out the supply side of the economy still allows for monetary policy to accommodate that.”
> Schmid, along with other regional central bank presidents, said that the Federal Reserve should keep interest rates at their current levels while they watch for inflation to subside. Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan said that the federal funds rate is near its “neutral” point, where it neither constrains nor stimulates the economy.
> The central bank kept interest rates steady at its most recent meeting in January after cutting interest rates at the prior three meetings. Investors are pricing in a strong likelihood that the Fed will again hold rates steady when it issues its next decision on March 18, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.
> “Looking ahead, I anticipate we’ll see progress on inflation this year,” Logan said. “But I am not yet fully confident inflation is heading all the way back to 2%.”
> Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack also said the Fed should keep rates where they are, given that inflation remains high. She added that the tariff policies championed by Trump will still likely affect inflation.
> “One notable development over the last year has been the rise in goods inflation, especially for items that are more exposed to global trade,” Hammack said. “While some firms have already passed these costs along, others say that more price increases are coming.”
> But in separate remarks earlier this week, Miran argued the impacts of tariffs on the U.S. economy have been “quite muted,” according to a report from Reuters. In comments at the Boston University Questrom School of Business, Miran said that he disagreed with reports indicating that American consumers were largely bearing the brunt of Trump’s tariffs.
> Kansas City Federal Reserve. “Monetary Policy and the Economic Outlook.”
> Fox Business. “Deregulation will allow the economy to produce more, Federal Reserve governor says.”
> Dallas Federal Reserve. “Outlook for the economy and monetary policy.”
> Cleveland Federal Reserve. “Recipe for a Thriving US Economy: Strong Banks, Patient Policy, and an Independent yet Accountable Central Bank.”
> Reuters. “Fed's Miran says data suggests Americans aren't shouldering tariff hit.”

> US President Donald Trump continued his call for more rate cuts after the jobs data was released.
> Published Feb 12, 2026, 11:07 AM
> WASHINGTON – Unexpectedly strong US employment data for January has reduced the odds the Federal Reserve will see a need to cut interest rates again by mid-2026.
> Worries about rising unemployment, which prompted three rate cuts at the end of 2025 before a pause in January, were likely eased by numbers released on Feb 11 showing that 130,000 jobs were added in January.
> 130,000 jobs were added in January.
> Unemployment also fell to 4.3 per cent in January.
> Fed officials at January’s policy meeting had already cited signs of stabilisation as a reason to hold rates steady.
> The Feb 11 report prompted traders to cut the odds of a rate cut at the June meeting – previously seen as the most likely timing for the next reduction – to under 50 per cent.
> Economists cautioned that the upbeat January numbers could yet be revised lower, and that hiring continues to be dominated by a handful of sectors, primarily healthcare.
> Revisions to 2025 data showed that job gains averaged just 15,000 a month, down from an initially reported 49,000 a month.
> Yet the bounce in January will calm fears that unemployment is set to keep climbing amid worries over the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) and widespread concerns that companies are putting hiring plans on hold, said Santander US Capital Markets chief US economist Stephen Stanley.
> Kansas City Fed president Jeff Schmid, speaking on Feb 11, said the central bank needs to keep rates at restrictive levels to continue putting downward pressure on inflation. He added that he is not seeing many indications of restraint in the economic data.
> US President Donald Trump continued to call for more rate cuts. In a social media post after the jobs data was released, he hailed the “Great Jobs Numbers” and said the United States should be paying the lowest interest rates globally.
> Mr Trump’s National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett told the Fox Business Network there is “plenty of room for the Fed to cut rates”, citing a big supply shock from AI that will boost growth without creating inflation.
> Mr Kevin Warsh, whom Mr Trump has said he will nominate to take over as Fed chair after Mr Jerome Powell’s term ends in May, has echoed those views.
> Fed watchers cautioned that it is too soon to make calls on where the economy will be by June – when Mr Warsh would chair his first policy meeting if he is confirmed by then.
> For now, key indicators suggest a firming labour market and broader economy, neither of which immediately supports Mr Warsh’s calls for lower rates, said Wolfe Research chief economist Stephanie Roth.
> “It makes his job a little bit harder,” she said. BLOOMBERG

## 📌 Topic: Geopolitical Tensions & Energy Security (Russia/Ukraine, China)
*(Found 5 articles)*

### 1. [Russia's resilient shift to China amid sanctions, tariffs, and geopolitical reckoning for India and West](https://www.ibtimes.co.in/russias-resilient-shift-china-amid-sanctions-tariffs-geopolitical-reckoning-india-west-898157)
**Source**: IBTimes India | **Date**: 2026-02-12T13:37:00+00:00

> In the intricate and often unforgiving arena of global energy geopolitics, few shifts carry the profound resonance of Russia's accelerating pivot toward China as its primary crude oil lifeline. This transformation, accelerated by relentless Western sanctions and targeted U.S. trade pressures on India, has now reached a crescendo. Yesterday Russian seaborne crude exports to China surged to an unprecedented 1.86 million barrels per day, marking a staggering 46 percent increase year-on-year and eclipsing Saudi Arabia as Beijing's top supplier for the month. For the first time in recorded history, 100 percent of Russia's Eastern Siberia-Pacific Ocean crude, or ESPO blend, flowed exclusively to Chinese ports, underscoring a deliberate and strategic rerouting that has reshaped supply chains, fortified alliances, and exposed vulnerabilities across the international order.
> This pivot is no mere market adjustment; it is a testament to Russia's adaptability in the face of adversity, China's opportunistic mastery of energy diplomacy, and the unintended consequences of Western isolation strategies. As India grapples with U.S.-imposed tariffs and sanctions that have compelled a sharp reduction in its Russian imports, the barrels once destined for South Asian refineries have not evaporated they have simply migrated eastward, deepening an asymmetrical Sino-Russian partnership that challenges American hegemony and tests the resilience of multipolar institutions like BRICS. Drawing on extensive data from trade analytics firms, customs reports, and expert analyses, this article delves into the economic mechanics, strategic undercurrents, and broader implications of this realignment, revealing a world where energy flows increasingly dictate the contours of power.
> The Economic Mechanics: Record Flows, Discounts, and the Redistribution of Barrels
> At the heart of this shift lies a confluence of economic incentives and geopolitical necessities. Russia's total crude exports to China, encompassing both seaborne and pipeline deliveries, averaged 2.17 million barrels per day throughout 2025, a modest 1 percent rise from 2024, yet sufficient to set a new annual record and cement Moscow's position as Beijing's largest supplier. By January 2026, seaborne volumes alone had escalated dramatically, with over half of the cargoes loading from Kozmino and Sakhalin ports. The Yulong refinery in Shandong province, a key independent "teapot" facility, processed an exclusive 240,000 barrels per day of Russian crude, benefiting from transit times as short as five to six days far more efficient and secure than routes to distant buyers.
> Discounts have been the lubricant of this trade. Urals crude, Russia's flagship export grade, traded at discounts of up to 12 dollars per barrel below the Brent benchmark in late 2025, widening to near-record levels of 7 to 9 dollars by early 2026 as sellers sought to offset potential losses from India's retreat. ESPO blend discounts followed suit, reaching 9 dollars per barrel, with Russia assuming the burdens of logistics, insurance, and sanctions evasion through its expanding "shadow fleet" of tankers. As one veteran oil trader in Singapore observed, "These barrels don't disappear they reroute to the buyer willing to absorb the risk at the right price. China is securing large, proximate, and predictable supplies while minimizing exposure to politically fragile alternatives like Iran or Venezuela."
> India's pullback has been equally dramatic, driven by a potent mix of U.S. sanctions and trade leverage. Once peaking at over 2.2 million barrels per day in mid-2025—accounting for 35 to 36 percent of India's total imports Russian crude inflows plummeted to around 1.1 million barrels per day in January 2026, the lowest since late 2022. This decline followed a series of U.S. measures: sanctions on major Russian firms like Rosneft and Lukoil in October 2025, which took effect in November, and a 25 percent punitive tariff imposed in August 2025 on top of existing reciprocal duties, escalating India's effective rate to 50 percent. A February 2026 trade deal, hailed by President Donald Trump as a "win for American energy," rescinded the additional tariff, reducing it to 18 percent in exchange for India's commitment to phase out direct and indirect Russian oil purchases.
> The economic toll on India is multifaceted. New Delhi spent approximately 52 billion dollars on Russian oil in 2024, benefiting from discounts that shaved 12.2 dollars per barrel off import costs and helped stabilize domestic fuel prices for its 1.4 billion citizens. Now, as refiners diversify toward sources like Angola, Brazil, the United States, the UAE, and even Venezuela whose imports briefly resumed in 2023-2024 before halting again due to sanctions the transition inflates logistics expenses and reduces refining margins. Analysts estimate this could add 1 to 2 percent to India's overall crude import bill if replacements prove less competitive, turning energy procurement from a cost-saving opportunism into a geopolitical liability. As Mamdouh Salameh, an international oil economist, noted, "India's loss of leverage over cheap Russian barrels is permanent; re-accessing them will become harder as Russia locks in China as its dominant outlet."
> Russia, meanwhile, has demonstrated remarkable resilience. Despite a 2 percent drop in overall export volumes in 2024, revenues from crude rose 6 percent, buoyed by the pivot to Asia, which now absorbs over 90 percent of seaborne flows. Oil and gas revenues constitute 77.7 percent of Moscow's federal budget, and the redirection sustains this lifeline even as production dipped for a second consecutive month in early 2026. China alone accounted for 47 percent of Russia's crude exports in 2025, followed by India at 38 percent (pre-decline), Turkey at 6 percent, and the EU at a residual 6 percent. Yet this restructuring deepens Moscow's dependence on Beijing, an asymmetrical dynamic where Russia bears the costs of sanctions evasion to maintain volumes.
> The United States secures short-term tactical gains by disrupting Russia's revenue streams and pressuring allies, but the rerouting undermines long-term isolation efforts. As barrels flow eastward, Washington's strategy inadvertently bolsters the Sino-Russian axis, with China saving an estimated 10 billion dollars on sanctioned oil in 2023 alone. In essence, the economic winners and losers crystallize as follows: China as the paramount beneficiary with enhanced energy security; Russia sustaining its war economy through adaptation; India facing enduring costs and vulnerabilities; and the U.S. achieving fleeting disruptions at the expense of broader containment.
> Strategic and Geopolitical Ramifications: Forging an Enduring Sino-Russian Axis
> Beyond the balance sheets, this oil pivot amplifies strategic asymmetries and reshapes alliances. Energy has long been the bedrock of Sino-Russian relations, evolving from the 2014 Power of Siberia pipeline forged amid Russia's annexation of Crimea to prospective expansions like Power of Siberia 2, which could add 50 billion cubic meters of annual gas capacity. The current surge in crude flows reinforces this bond, providing Russia a steadfast partner against Western encirclement while granting China a potent counterweight in its rivalry with the United States. As a senior analyst at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization remarked, "This partnership exemplifies the broader restructuring of global energy systems along geopolitical lines, where mutual dependence fosters resilience against external pressures."
> For China, the gains are strategic gold: discounted barrels mitigate risks in traditional supply routes through the Strait of Malacca, enhance leverage in Asian markets, and align with Beijing's multipolar vision. By absorbing volumes once headed to India, China not only secures its refining needs amid weak domestic margins but also positions itself as the arbiter of Eurasian energy flows. This dynamic extends to military and diplomatic spheres, potentially deepening cooperation in forums like the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and BRICS, where Russia's isolation from the West amplifies China's influence.
> Russia emerges as a strategic gainer, sustaining itself despite sanctions that have severed 80 percent of its pre-2022 European pipeline gas markets. The pivot underscores Moscow's ability to evade restrictions through shadow fleets and alternative buyers, though infrastructure constraints such as limited eastward pipeline capacity cap full expansion. As Igor Sechin, CEO of Rosneft, highlighted at the 2025 Russian-Chinese Energy Business Forum, "Mutual trade reached a record 245 billion dollars in 2024, with energy comprising over a third, totaling around 100 billion dollars proof that sanctions have only accelerated our eastward orientation."
> India, however, confronts a strategic quagmire. Aligning with an "undependable" U.S. partner Indian Government has yielded tariff relief and promises of boosted bilateral trade to 500 billion dollars by 2030, but at the cost of alienating a time-tested ally in Russia. New Delhi's reliance on Moscow for defense systems over 60 percent of its military hardware and energy has been a cornerstone of its foreign policy since the Cold War. Now, as Russian barrels recede, India risks isolation in multilateral arenas, with analysts warning that a full break could undermine forums like RIC (Russia-India-China) and erode leverage against its primary rival, China. Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri's recent assertion that "national interest will guide our energy decisions" reflects this tension, but the reality is stark: succumbing to U.S. pressure has empowered Beijing while exposing India's vulnerabilities along contested borders.
> The United States, positioned as the largest long-term loser vis-à-vis its chief challenger, China, sees its sanctions strategy backfire. While tactical successes like curbing India's imports disrupt Moscow's revenues, they accelerate the consolidation of a Russia-China bloc that sustains Russia's Ukraine campaign and challenges American energy dominance in LNG and renewables. As one U.S. Energy Information Administration report cautioned, "Geopolitical tensions in one region can broadly impact global oil trade dynamics, amplifying spillovers in volatility and skewness."
> Transforming Global Trade Orders and Supply Chains: From Fragmentation to Blocs
> This pivot disrupts the architecture of global trade, fostering competing energy blocs and altering supply chains. Russia's shadow fleet, now comprising hundreds of aging tankers, evades price caps and embargoes, but the eastward rerouting shortens routes, reduces vulnerabilities, and lowers costs compared to longer voyages to India or Turkey. Current distributions highlight the shift: China at 47 percent, India at a declining 37 percent, the EU at 7 percent, and Turkey at 6 percent. Bilateral Russia-China trade dipped 6.5 percent in 2025 from 2024's record highs, yet energy remains the backbone, constituting 75 percent of exports.
> The implications for prices are nuanced. Deeper discounts may stabilize Brent benchmarks in the short term by increasing supply liquidity, but concentration of heavy crude flows risks heightening volatility in other markets. As independent refineries in Shandong absorb record volumes, global buyers face a more fragmented landscape, where economics intertwine with geopolitics.
> Evolving Military and Power Structures: Energy as the Sinews of Conflict
> Militarily, the enhanced ties carry ripple effects. Sustained revenues from China indirectly fund Russia's protracted efforts in Ukraine, where oil income bolsters a war machine resilient to sanctions. For China, secure energy underpins its Indo-Pacific ambitions, enabling a more assertive posture amid tensions with the U.S. and its allies. India, conversely, faces weakened defenses: diminished Russian support erodes its hand against China in Himalayan border disputes and broader regional balances. Studies from institutions like the Brookings Institution note that "sanctions have driven down Russian revenues temporarily, but the pivot to Asia sustains the Kremlin's ability to raise funds for its war machine."
> In a multipolar world, these dynamics signal a shift where energy flows redefine power structures, from critical infrastructure vulnerabilities to hybrid warfare strategies.
> Navigating the Dawn of a Fragmented Energy Order
> Russia's great oil pivot to China is a masterclass in geopolitical adaptation a survival tactic for Moscow, a strategic windfall for Beijing, and a cautionary narrative for Washington and New Delhi. As supply chains fragment into blocs and alliances solidify, the global community must confront an energy landscape where strategy eclipses pure economics. For India, the crossroads is poignant: has the pursuit of U.S. alignment sacrificed a reliable partner in Russia, only to embolden its greatest rival? The answers will unfold in the coming decade, demanding agile diplomacy to balance energy security, national interests, and the inexorable pull of multipolarity. In this new era, the true victors will be those who master not just the flow of oil, but the currents of power it propels.

### 2. [Europe's Clean Energy Push Creates New Geopolitical Risks](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Europes-Clean-Energy-Push-Creates-New-Geopolitical-Risks.html)

> Europe is still suffering from the consequences of its decadeslong dependence on Russian energy imports. But as the bloc continues to wean itself off of Russian oil and gas, Europe is facing new and compounding energy dependence threats from the United States and China. European policymakers are in a tough spot, literally and figuratively sandwiched between a massive and high-stakes battle for global energy supremacy.
> When Russia illegally invaded Ukraine in February of 2022, Europe as a whole depended on the Russian producers for 40 percent of its natural gas. Setting and following sanctions on Russian energy and finding more reliable and responsible supply chains over the last four years has not been easy. Only last week, European leaders finally agreed to end imports of Russian gas to the bloc – but that total ban still won’t take effect until next year.
> In the wake of these overnight embargoes on Russian energy, Europe has scrambled to intensify buildout of renewable resources. But this rapid expansion has led to major hiccups in the continent’s energy security, placing major strain on power grids and causing extreme volatility in electricity prices. To fill these gaps and shore up energy security over the past few years, Europe has eagerly increased its imports of liquefied natural gas from the United States. But now that decision, too, is seeming increasingly risky for European sovereignty and resilience.
> “Europe’s energy security is being redrawn by shifting global power plays – from America’s energy dominance to China’s technological monopoly,” the German Council on Foreign Relations warned in a memo published earlier this week. “Once considered tools of cooperation, energy resources and technologies are again being used for leverage.”
> In general, global geopolitics are trending toward an era of protectionism and nationalist policy, with potentially disastrous results for net energy importers. And Europe, which has clung to a free-trade ethos, is at risk of being caught in the crossfire between the United States and China as the world’s two biggest economies pull in opposite directions – one toward being the world’s first electrostate and the other toward petro-dominance. And both want to ensure that the entire world follows suit.
> While the United States was once considered a safe lifeline away from the tyrannical and unstable energy powers of Russia and China, experts contend that those dynamics are rapidly changing. The Council expresses genuine concern that the United States will now do anything to ensure its own energy dominance – including but not limited to the aggressive annexation of Greenland – without a second thought for its European alliances. But the alternative, cozying up to China, isn’t sounding so great either.
> As a result, the Council contends that “Germany should begin to consider US energy dominance, alongside Russian fossil statecraft and Chinese technological consolidation, as a potential systemic risk.”
> Trump’s aggression toward Greenland, in particular, has been a major pivot point for European leadership, pushing the continent to pursue energy independence with renewed vigor. Accordingly, nine countries with stakes in the North Sea have doubled down on the development of large-scale offshore wind projects that would include the development of a grid connected to multiple European nations.
> While this new agreement is focused on strengthening Europe’s energy independence, leaders say that it doesn’t signal a desire to end trade relations with the United States. EU energy commissioner Dan Jørgensen has said: “We are not against trading with the US — on the contrary. But we are of course aware — and this goes for all countries, not only the US — that we are not aiming at replacing one dependency with a new dependency. We want to grow our own energy and our strategy in the future is to become free of gas.”
> In the meantime, Europe is also keen to develop more diverse suppliers and “mutually beneficial energy partnerships with like-minded partners eager to avoid asymmetrical and transactional dependencies,” according to the German Council on Foreign Relations.

**Source**: Energy Intelligence | **Date**: 2026-02-12T21:40:00+00:00

> Trilateral negotiations between the US, Russia and Ukraine are again in focus, but a permanent peace deal appears distant, as it would first require a durable ceasefire. The status of territory in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region and Western security guarantees for Ukraine remain major sticking points. Russia maintains maximalist demands despite its war economy coming under strain from weak oil prices and faltering revenues. Ukraine faces pressure from Washington to make concessions and seal a swift peace deal, a direction it is moving in. But the real test will be the Kremlin’s response. Europe will also have a say, and its position is hardening, with an upcoming EU sanctions package expected to tighten the screws on the "shadow fleet" and Brussels set to provide a €90 billion ($107 billion) loan to Ukraine.

> BILZEN-HOESELT, Belgium (AP) — European Union leaders broadly agreed Thursday on a plan to restructure the 27-nation bloc’s economy to make it more competitive as they face antagonism from U.S. President Donald Trump, strong-arm tactics from China and hybrid threats blamed on Russia.
> Meeting in a Belgian castle, the EU leaders agreed an “action plan” with a strict timeline for the economic restructuring, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said. “The pressure and the sense of urgency is enormous, and that can move mountains,” she said.
> The plan, to be presented formally in March, would include measures to coordinate upgrading energy grids, deepen financial integration and loosen merger regulations to allow European firms to grow to better compete globally, she said.
> “We need European champions,” von der Leyen said.
> European Council President António Costa described the meeting as a “real game changer” as leaders threw their weight behind plans to further integrate and simplify the bloc’s financial systems.
> The meeting had started with an image of unity between the two traditional power centers of the EU after each had publicly staked out different strategic positions. French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz arrived together, crossing a drawbridge side by side into the 16th-century Alden Biesen castle.
> “We share this sense of urgency that Europe must take action,” Macron said while standing on a blue welcome carpet next to his German counterpart.
> “We want to make this European Union faster, we want to make it better, and above all we want to ensure that we have competitive industry in Europe,” Merz said.
> Merz and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni lead a wing of the bloc calling for deregulation, rebooting Europe’s relationship with Washington and forging trade deals like the recent one struck with the Mercosur nations of South America.
> The EU “cannot continue to hyperregulate,” said Meloni. “There’s no time to lose.”
> France instead is leading a push for “strategic autonomy ” — meaning a bloc less dependent on Washington.
> Macron argues that EU countries should buy exclusively from European producers as the continent pursues greater military spending as a response to Russian aggression in Ukraine. Merz and Meloni say purchases should be from both foreign and European firms.
> In comments to reporters as he arrived, Macron said he was urging his partners to protect “sectors that are particularly under threat” like cleantech, chemicals, steel, the car industry and defense.
> “There is also an increased pressure on us, with competition — sometimes unfair competition — that is very intense, with very strong pressure from China, tariffs imposed on us by the Americans with threats of coercive practices,” Macron said.
> EU leaders will also debate new financial instruments to protect the bloc in a global trading system rocked by Trump’s blitzkrieg of tariffs and China’s restricting of critical mineral exports.
> Macron is renewing his call for the EU to be able to borrow money, which he described as “Eurobonds for the future” that would provide an opportunity “to challenge the hegemony of the dollar.”
> Most leaders are calling for action along the lines of the economic stimulus strategy called for by Mario Draghi, former head of the European Central Bank. The 2024 plan includes cutting regulations, making infrastructure investments and establishing trade ties with more countries.
> Both Draghi and Enrico Letta, a former Italian Prime Minister, beseeched leaders assembled in the castle to drastically restructure and integrate the bloc’s economy.
> “We have way too many barriers that prevent money and capital from moving from one country to another, way too many obstacles to simplification,” said Roberta Metsola, president of the European Parliament.
> “No more words, but more action,” said Metsola, who like Merz and von der Leyen is a leading figure in the European People’s Party, which is the largest bloc in the European Parliament and claims 13 heads of EU states as members.
> Citizens across the bloc are hungry for a stronger EU and a more unified, stronger and ambitious leadership amid military threats, economic pressures and climate instability, according to an official EU poll, Eurobarometer.
> “There has never been a better time for European leaders, national political leaders, to actually leverage on these European citizens’ demand for greater European action,” said Alberto Alemanno, a professor of EU law at the HEC Paris business school.

> EU leaders pledged after talks Thursday to move ahead swiftly with reforms to revive Europe's flagging economy but were split on calls for joint debt to help the bloc confront twin threats from China and the United States.
> Reducing Europe's dependencies on countries outside the bloc has gained greater urgency because of geopolitical shocks, intensified global competition and an economy that lags behind bigger powers.
> Leaders agree on a common diagnosis that Europe's moribund economy needs a kickstart and had hoped a day of "brainstorming" in a castle in eastern Belgium would help them agree on the cure.
> "We share the same sense of urgency. We need to act immediately and accelerate, because we are being pushed around by international competition," French President Emmanuel Macron said after the talks.
> The discussion "brought a new energy" on building a more resilient economy, echoed EU chief Antonio Costa, promising "concrete measures" would be taken in the next leaders' meeting in March.
> "One Europe, one market," European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters, vowing to better integrate the EU's single market to unlock private capital that the bloc's companies need to scale up.
> But big divisions remained on show among the EU's 27 capitals.
> Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz sought to present a united front when arriving at the talks, but the key powers have publicly diverged on France's push to favour EU companies and for more joint debt.
> On the crucial matter of debt, the lines did not appear to have moved.
> "We have taken on European debt in exceptional situations -- but those were exceptional situations," Merz said afterwards.
> "We have to make do with the money we have," he said.
> Macron also warned that climate action should not be sacrificed on the altar of boosting the economy, saying it would be a "strategic error" to abandon it -- contrasting with Merz's strong push to slash EU red tape across all sectors.
> The French-backed "Buy European" push remained on the table after Thursday's talks, despite protectionism concerns by free trade advocates including Sweden and the Netherlands -- but with caveats.
> "On European preference, I feel that there is a broad agreement on the need to use it in the selected strategic sectors, in the proportional and targeted way," Costa said.
> The EU executive will publish a proposal this month for rules that would demand governments prioritise European-made goods in public contracts.
> Macron said the leaders would define which sectors during the March summit.
> Merz has said the EU should seek a "Made with Europe" approach rather than "Made in Europe, a message echoed by Japanese companies.
> In the latest draft seen by AFP Thursday, the commission appeared to open the door to Germany's wishes with the proposal that it would identify "trusted partners" and allow content from them to be "equivalent" to European content.
> Partners could include countries like Japan with whom the EU has a trade deal.
> The EU's list of concerns is long including lacklustre economic growth compared with its global rivals, and dependence on countries outside the bloc including China for rare earths essential for industry.
> Leaders, backed by influential European figures, believe the key to transforming the 27-country bloc's economy is to deepen the single market and make it easier for businesses to work across the continent.
> They heard from former European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi and Italian ex-premier Enrico Letta, the authors of 2024 reports guiding Europe.
> Draghi told leaders the EU must reduce barriers and mobilise Europeans' savings and backed the call for "targeted" preference for European companies, an EU official said.
> Two paths promoted by the EU to become more competitive are "simplifying" EU rules to reduce the administrative burden for businesses and striking more trade deals -- easier said than done.
> A recent trade agreement with the South American Mercosur bloc has come up against fierce opposition while changes to EU laws have been bogged down in the bloc's legislative process.
> Draghi also called for "enhanced cooperation", which would mean EU states that want to can move forward on certain reforms if the 27 states can't agree.
> Macron warned that if progress is not made on reforming the single market by June, willing EU states should move forward without others.
> The EU executive will also propose next month the creation of a new legal system for businesses outside of the scope of member states -- the so-called 28th regime -- to make it easier for companies to work across the bloc.

> European Union leaders have agreed on the need for reforms to revive Europe's struggling economy but left an EU summit with diverging views on the role of public funding.
> German Chancellor Friedrich Merz reiterated his opposition to financing reforms through joint debt instruments such as eurobonds at the close of the gathering on Thursday.
> "I made it very clear that, even if there are other opinions on the matter, I cannot agree to financing European Union projects through eurobonds," Merz said after the meeting at Alden Biesen Castle in Belgium.
> He noted that Germany's Federal Constitutional Court has set clear limits on joint borrowing and stressed: "We have to make do with the money we have."
> The summit was convened to find common ground on how to respond to growing global competition from the United States and China and to address internal challenges such as high energy prices, excessive bureaucracy and complex rules that hamper growth in the 27-member bloc.
> French President Emmanuel Macron and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni expressed support for taking on joint debt.
> "Innovation requires more financing, matter of fact. You can like it or not, but it's a matter of fact," Macron said.
> He urged fellow leaders to calmly consider raising money on capital markets for shared priorities.
> Merz said that financing would be discussed in the coming weeks and months, calling it "a very difficult undertaking."
> Reducing barriers and boosting investment
> Despite disagreements over funding, EU leaders agreed to push for reducing persistent trade barriers within the bloc to improve the investment environment and foster growth.
> Experts say the fragmentation of national rules costs the EU more than external tariffs.
> But efforts to streamline national rules for businesses and financial markets have proven difficult.
> As a result, the bloc is considering introducing an additional set of EU-wide corporate rules for companies operating across multiple member states.
> A proposal is expected before the next leaders' meeting in March and aims to allow companies to operate seamlessly across the EU with a single set of rules, European Council President António Costa said.
> Leaders also agreed to accelerate work on harmonizing capital markets across the EU to attract private investment.
> "Europe needs a single and efficient financial system which can better turn European savings into investments," Costa said.
> The European Commission has proposed creating a so-called savings and investment union, although harmonizing financial rules has been challenging in the past.
> Other ideas discussed include giving preference to European companies in certain sectors to channel more funds into domestic economies.
> Costa highlighted defence, space, clean technologies, quantum technologies, artificial intelligence and payment systems as strategic areas.
> Energy prices, carbon pricing and reform pressure
> Europe's industry continues to struggle with comparatively high energy prices.
> European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen pledged to advance efforts to reduce dependence on fossil fuel imports, integrate energy markets and improve grid infrastructure.
> High energy costs have also fuelled resistance to the EU's carbon pricing system, particularly in countries that rely heavily on fossil fuels for electricity and heating.
> Under the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), businesses in sectors such as electricity generation, industrial manufacturing and aviation must buy allowances for their greenhouse gas emissions.
> The system currently covers around 40% of total EU emissions.
> Von der Leyen said the Commission would present a long-planned assessment of the ETS in the coming months.
> Leaders pledged to accelerate reforms, although Europe's economic challenges have persisted for years.
> Industry representatives expressed frustration over the slow pace of change, urging leaders to move from plans to concrete results.
> "We urge you to move from diagnosis to delivery, and from plans to results, with a single objective: Save our industry. Not next year, not next week, but today," a joint statement by leading European companies said.

### 4. [America and China at the Edge of Ruin](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/america-and-china-edge-ruin-lampton-jisi)
**Source**: Foreign Affairs | **Date**: 2026-02-12T07:43:00+00:00

> A Last Chance to Step Back From the Brink
> David M. Lampton and Wang Jisi
> Since the early 2010s, the relationship between Beijing and Washington has steadily shifted from cautious engagement to tense rivalry. Step by step, both sides have adopted national security strategies that treat the other not merely as a competitor but as the principal threat to their core values, political legitimacy, and vital national interests. This evolution has been driven not only by external events but also by domestic political incentives, bureaucratic maneuvering, and deeply rooted anxieties about vulnerability, decline, and status. Each country’s increasingly muscular attempts to deter the other have caused rising friction in the realms of defense, economics, culture, and diplomacy. What began as hedging behavior has hardened into mutually reinforcing strategic postures that assume long-term hostility as the organizing principle of policy.
> A world in which the two most powerful countries organize their strategies around mutual enmity is one marked by arms races, institutional paralysis, and the neglect of shared threats such as climate change, pandemic infection, and financial instability. In such a world, conflicts can readily spiral out of control. In the absence of meaningful guardrails, the present trajectory risks locking both societies and the international system into a condition of managed hostility, diminished prosperity, and chronic insecurity—a condition in which competition becomes an end in itself and the costs are borne not by Beijing and Washington alone but by the whole world.
> The world, in other words, will be a far more unhealthy, unequal, and perilous place if Beijing and Washington accelerate their competition and continue to narrow the space for collective problem solving. Moreover, with an escalation in tensions that is driven by mistrust and domestic political pressures, the danger today lies less in a deliberate conflict than in an accidental one. Take the April 2001 collision between a Chinese fighter jet and a U.S. EP-3 reconnaissance plane near China’s Hainan Island. Or the May 1999 U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, which the United States maintains was accidental. Were such incidents to happen under today’s circumstances, they could trigger not just a war but a nuclear war.
> Yet this trajectory is not irreversible. The coming months may present a rare window in which political developments, economic imperatives, and strategic fatigue on both sides create conditions conducive to stabilizing and normalizing bilateral relations. Such opportunities are delicate. As veteran scholars in the United States and China, we have lived through nearly six decades of fluctuation in the bilateral relationship, and we understand the shadow of confrontation between our two countries. But we also loathe the possibility of another generation entering a new cold war. Without timely and deliberate policy action, inertia and rivalry will prevail by default, raising the risk of a confrontation with global consequences. What the world needs is not so much a return to the traditional forms of U.S.-Chinese engagement as a new normalization of relations that pulls each side back from the brink.
> As it stands, each side views the other through the lens of worst-case assumptions. In Washington, China is generally defined as the primary systemic challenger to U.S. global leadership, technological primacy, economic dominance, and democratic norms. In Beijing, the United States is widely perceived as the central force attempting to contain China’s rise, undermine the Chinese Communist Party, and preserve “America first” supremacy at China’s expense. These perceptions are no longer confined to rhetoric; they are embedded in military planning, alliance and partnership structures, export control regimes, and public diplomacy, effectively locking both countries into a persistent state of distrust and reactivity that not even friendly summits between the countries’ leaders can unwind.
> The depth and consequences of this reality are visible in the military, economic, and diplomatic domains. For instance, military deterrence has become progressively more complex, uncertain, and difficult to achieve thanks to the rapid modernization of nuclear and conventional forces, as well as the expansion of new warfighting capabilities in space, cybertechnology, and artificial intelligence–enabled systems. This complexity will encourage our countries to hedge by multiplying both the number of weapons and their diversity. A rapidly escalating arms race is already underway, adding more uncertainty and ever more cost to the mix. The western Pacific, meanwhile, has seen intensified naval and air encounters, with several near misses between Chinese and U.S. forces. The danger of kinetic conflict, whether through miscalculation, accident, or crisis escalation, is no longer theoretical. And such a conflict would be between two nuclear powers and the world’s two largest economies.
> Economically, U.S.-Chinese interdependence was once seen as an indispensable stabilizing force in bilateral ties, and it unquestionably contributed to global economic growth. In 2001, when China joined the World Trade Organization, its per capita GDP was $1,065 and the United States’ was $37,133. By 2023, the corresponding figures were $12,951 in China and $82,769 in the United States. Both countries greatly enhanced their respective positions during that period, although internal dislocations in both countries had disruptive effects: China’s northeast was hit hard by unemployment, as was the United States’ Midwest.
> For these reasons and the increasingly fraught security relationship in recent years, both countries have come to see interdependence primarily as a vulnerability, with economics subordinated to national security. Sweeping export controls, industrial policies, and supply chain realignments have taken precedence over efficiency and growth, and the language of “decoupling,” “de-risking,” and “self-reliance” reflects a broader reality: both countries are willing to absorb significant economic costs to reduce reliance on the other. This erosion of the economic pillar of the relationship not only undermines bilateral stability but also contributes to global market fragmentation and uncertainty. The recent disruptions in the trade of rare-earth elements and the sale of high-capacity chips are two notable examples.
> Culturally and diplomatically, mutual mistrust now shapes public narratives and foreign policy identity. Although China does not publish the number of American visitors it has each year, it is widely accepted to be a mere fraction of what it was before the COVID-19 pandemic; indeed, very few Westerners are seen on the streets of Beijing these days. Academic and scientific cooperation has become particularly constrained, with the number of Chinese students receiving F-1 visas from the U.S. State Department falling nearly 27 percent between 2024 and 2025. Students, professors, and researchers in both countries are looking over their shoulders. Some U.S. states are passing legislation to curtail cooperation with Chinese educational institutions, and Chinese educators will tell you that low-level officials in their country are wary of assuming responsibility for initiating new intellectual ventures with Americans. With people-to-people ties fraying, each government is increasingly willing to frame the relationship in geopolitical and civilizational terms, raising the stakes beyond mere policy disagreements and making any hint of compromise politically noxious at home.
> The two of us have seen this before. We are both approaching 80 years old, and we remember when U.S.-Chinese hostility was not abstract but tangible—expressed through war, ideological antipathy, and the fear of nuclear annihilation. For Americans of this age, the Korean War was a national trauma that reinforced images of China, along with its ally North Korea, as a battlefield adversary. People lost loved ones and friends. More than 30,000 American soldiers died during the hostilities on the Korean Peninsula, and the war entrenched a political culture of suspicion that shaped education, media, and public life for decades. The subsequent war in Vietnam, in which the United States fought an adversary allied with China and the Soviet Union, extended that sense of permanent mobilization. Young Americans were exposed to mass casualties and moral uncertainty, and the war ultimately caused the death of over 58,000 Americans, many of whom had been conscripted into service. Even those who did not serve in either conflict lived under the discipline of Cold War preparedness, practicing nuclear attack drills in schools and absorbing the reality that cities could be erased in minutes.
> The equivalent Chinese generation endured even more disruption. The Korean War demanded immense national sacrifice from a newly founded state, sending millions of soldiers across the Yalu River into the Korean Peninsula and diverting scarce resources from desperately needed domestic reconstruction. People in China are taught that Chinese soldiers fought heroically in the Korean War, that more than 180,000 died, and that they defeated the Americans on many battlefields. But Chinese people today also know that the result was a strategic stalemate along the 38th parallel, where the war started. And the costs of fighting the United States indirectly in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia were staggering. According to Chinese reports, at the request of Hanoi, Beijing clandestinely and successively dispatched troops to Vietnam for air defense, engineering, and logistics. From 1965 to 1968, over 320,000 Chinese troops were sent to Vietnam.
> Our generation learned firsthand how strategic hostility seeps into classrooms, families, and personal aspirations. We experienced sustained hostility between Beijing and Washington not as an abstract geopolitical game but as a deeply human tragedy whose real costs could be measured in lost lives, lost opportunities, and generations shaped by fear rather than possibility.
> By the early 1970s, leaders of both countries recognized that these costs were too high. After backchannel meetings between their respective deputies, Zhou Enlai and Henry Kissinger, Chinese leader Mao Zedong and U.S. President Richard Nixon initiated a top-down process to repair relations in 1972. Because the two societies could not comprehensively engage with each other, it fell to these leaders to correct misperceptions and foster peace and cooperation.
> Today, there are signs that Xi and U.S. President Donald Trump might welcome a similar moment. For starters, in October 2025, Xi and Trump met in Busan, South Korea. Both leaders stressed cooperation and de-escalation in U.S.-Chinese relations, especially on trade, although with some notable caveats. Xi said China and the United States should be “partners and friends,” urging both sides to focus on long-term mutual benefits and to let trade and economic cooperation anchor the relationship rather than fuel friction. According to news reports, China agreed to resume purchasing American soybeans, to suspend rare-earth export controls, and to work with Washington to curb illicit fentanyl trafficking.
> In response, Trump sought to reset the tone of U.S.-Chinese relations. He called Xi “a tremendous leader of a very powerful country,” signaling a clear shift—at least rhetorically—toward diplomacy and trade-based cooperation over confrontation. His optimism for a broader deal suggested the meeting was intended not as an endpoint but as a steppingstone toward more comprehensive economic cooperation. He also referred to the summit as a gathering of the “G-2,” which signaled to Beijing a new, higher level of respect.
> This should not be taken lightly. Chinese leaders are most prickly when they sense that the United States is trying to deny them respect and isolate them and when they sense they are in a weaker position than Washington. In the Obama era, Washington explicitly rejected Beijing’s call for “a new model of major-country relations” and dismissed suggestions that China be considered half of a new G-2. Now, however, with China’s gains in strength and stature—and Washington’s missteps in domestic and foreign policy—Beijing is feeling more confident, a sentiment that Trump’s comments bolstered.
> To be clear, Beijing and Washington should not pursue some kind of dual hegemony that would rightly alarm their neighbors and middle powers far and wide. But they should make room for each other in the international system and regional security architectures. Doing so reassures other countries that they are not about to become victims of a runaway great-power competition. Going forward, both Beijing and Washington should ground their interactions in the reality of multipolarity and multialignment.
> The South Korean meeting fell short of a deep reset since it focused mainly on trade and sidestepped major strategic issues such as technological competition, supply chain decoupling, and security tensions. But since the meeting, Trump has extended an olive branch on technology: in December 2025, he announced that the American chipmaker Nvidia would be allowed to sell its second most powerful semiconductor chips to China—a decision that rolled back, somewhat, policies aimed at blocking Chinese access to advanced technologies. According to Trump, “President Xi responded positively.”
> There are also signs that both societies would welcome taking a step back from the brink. Public opinion polls in both countries indicate that people increasingly view the current path of confrontation as too costly. Attitudes are converging on the idea that both governments should focus more on healing domestic ills—from inequality and beyond—and reduce or avoid external adventures. A recent Chicago Council on Global Affairs poll, for instance, found that a majority of Americans, 53 percent, now say the United States “should undertake friendly cooperation and engagement with China,” up from 40 percent in 2024. A poll published in December 2025 by Tsinghua University’s Center for International Security and Strategy, meanwhile, shows that Chinese citizens are softening toward the United States. When asked to rate their opinion of the United States on a favorability scale of one to five, respondents gave an average score of 2.38, which is up from the 2024 average of 1.85. (For comparison, India’s favorability was 2.06 in 2025, and Russia’s favorability fell from 3.66 in 2024 to 3.48 in 2025.)
> Beijing and Washington, after all, have a common economic need at the moment and for the foreseeable future: to build or rebuild a strong, stable middle class. Sustained conflict between the two countries would significantly hurt both economies and this effort. In China, this dynamic was evident at the Fourth Plenary meeting of the Communist Party’s Central Committee, held last October. The meeting was suffused with the idea that the economy needs to be reenergized, in part through economic policies that are more resilient, less rigid, and free from foreign policy distractions. The members declared that China should “advance reform and development through greater openness and seek to share opportunities and achieve common development with the rest of the world.” This attitude is reminiscent of former paramount Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping’s reform thinking, which argued that China should pacify the outside world so it could draw more resources from abroad and focus on building its domestic strength. Deng’s reforms unleashed four decades of dramatic growth in China beginning in the late 1970s. An upcoming test of China’s economic development policy will be the degree to which Xi actually puts more priority on nonstate economic organizations and creates conditions for greater domestic innovation.
> The Trump administration’s “America first” mantra and the Democrats’ message of prioritizing affordability are similarly reflective of a country that is internally focused. As the administration’s 2025 National Security Strategy declared, “The days of the United States propping up the entire world order like Atlas are over.” This does not necessarily mean the United States will pursue isolationism—as the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in January proved—but rather that it is seeking a closer alignment between its resources and its commitments and is placing a greater focus on domestic ills, including affordability, drugs, unemployment, and inflation, and its relations with nearby regions. A confrontation with China does not appear to fit within this calculus: whereas Trump’s 2017 NSS was explicitly structured around great-power competition with Beijing, the second Trump NSS barely refers to China. A single warm day does not spell the end of the winter freeze, but it is a start.
> The best place to begin stabilizing the relationship is, perhaps counterintuitively, with its most dangerous dimension: the long-simmering issue of Taiwan. The growing volatility in the Taiwan Strait makes it important to address this issue quickly, and it might even be easier to reduce tensions than many believe.
> China’s 2005 Anti-Secession Law sets out specific conditions under which Beijing may resort to “nonpeaceful means” to resolve the Taiwan question: namely, if Taiwan declares independence, if major incidents occur that would lead to Taiwan’s separation from China, or if all possibilities for peaceful unification are completely exhausted. By the Chinese government’s own legal and political standards, current cross-strait conditions do not meet those criteria. Moreover, despite frequent speculation and emotionally charged commentary on social media, Beijing has not officially declared that a military takeover of Taiwan is imminent or inevitable. Instead, the Chinese government continues to reaffirm its preference for peaceful unification, insisting that it is stepping up full-scale deterrence, such as encircling the island with extensive live-fire exercises, only to prevent secession.
> In other words, despite a tense military atmosphere, it is still possible to relax the political hostility over the Taiwan Strait. Now is the right moment for the two countries to reassure each other. It is in Beijing’s interest to reiterate its peaceful intentions, and it is in Washington’s interest to reinstate its previous position that it “does not support Taiwan independence.”
> Although such statements might be dismissed as mere lip service, they carry real weight. Words and behavior matter. In early November 2025, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi created a firestorm in China when she said Japan could become involved in a conflict over Taiwan under certain circumstances. In the minds of many Chinese, the remarks tied Japan closer to Taiwan. The Chinese-Japanese relationship has deteriorated significantly since then, with China applying economic and diplomatic pressure on Japan. If Washington were to reiterate its disapproval of any potential unilateral declaration of independence by Taipei, it would not only reassure Beijing but also show Tokyo that Washington wants to lower the temperature in the region.
> Beijing and Washington can also take steps toward a new normalization by addressing more malleable issues, such as economic and cultural obstacles, on which there is already significant societal agreement in both countries. China and the United States could, for example, reopen their respective consulates in Houston and Chengdu, which were closed in a display of tit-for-tat retaliation in July 2020.
> Beijing and Washington could also negotiate a reciprocal, dramatic drop in the average tariff rate that each is applying to the other. In addition, China could consider reducing subsidy levels on some of its exports. Tariffs and trade barriers are hurting the most vulnerable segments of the U.S. and Chinese populations, and their capricious implementation feeds corruption in both countries and in third parties around the world. Although China and the United States think they are using economic leverage to constrain the other, over time, tools such as tariffs and export controls will lose their edge and ultimately weaken both economies. A better approach would be to recognize that the pursuit of comparative advantage is the best starting point for trade policy. This does not mean a return to total free trade—each country has identified dependencies that are counter to national security and must be addressed. But it does mean that the average tariff rate should be at its lowest possible level consistent with national security and reciprocity.
> Both countries could also take steps to break down cultural walls and nurture a more accurate understanding of each other’s rapidly changing societies. Some American observers, for instance, expect China’s political structure to drastically change in ways similar to the shifts that brought about the collapse of the Soviet Union. Meanwhile, many Chinese analysts believe that China will soon catch up with the United States in economic, technological, and military terms. In reality, neither outcome is likely. Yet such misperceptions have already influenced actions and policies, harming the long-term interests of the two countries. If each country’s impression of the other is not balanced by realistic and objective forecasts, there is the very real danger that each side will exaggerate its own power and underestimate the other’s.
> Oddly enough, the opposite danger also exists—each side could see its own position eroding quickly and become anxious enough to take action sooner rather than later. In some Chinese circles, for instance, there is a lack of confidence about China’s ability to resist external pressure in support of Taiwan’s separation from China. Likewise, there is anxiety among some Americans that the United States will soon lose its technological edge over China. In other words, each country has become something of a mystery to the other, which feeds the chances of miscalculation.
> An important means by which to diminish these perceptions is to encourage deeper connections and engagements across all sections of society. The constraints on journalists, for example, should be relaxed. And academic and research exchanges should be restored to their pre-pandemic levels. Government action in both these domains is only one part of the solution, however. In order to change the atmosphere, our respective citizens have to want to participate, as well. To that end, authorities in both societies might create a more hospitable environment by not categorically referring to each other’s students, scholars, and media as spies.
> Finally, it is incumbent on both sides to once again pursue military-­to-military talks not only to reduce the chance of accidents and misperceptions but also to see whether Beijing and Washington can work on some of the issues driving the arms race between them. Such talks must be grounded in the recognition that U.S.-Chinese tensions over trade, technology, ideology, and security are not a mere blip but part of a long arc. The starting point should be a joint affirmation (perhaps a joint statement) that there is space for both countries in Asia and beyond and that efforts to reduce tensions need to be taken with urgency.
> Today, policymakers and scholars in both countries have extraordinary analytical tools at their disposal, including artificial intelligence, that earlier generations did not. This technical capacity is essential to the sound management of global relationships. But even the most sophisticated policymakers reliant on advanced technology cannot simulate a real war, which would impose an unbearable loss of life. Preventing a deadly confrontation between China and the United States will thus require something else: strategic memory, crisis experience, and cross-cultural trust that is built over decades.
> Our two countries have the opportunity now to rebuild these guardrails. While the tone at the top has, thus far, softened, it is by no means institutionalized; the carefully managed equilibrium could prove wobbly. If Beijing and Washington lose this chance for a new normalization, it will be impossible for them to protect their strategic interests in the future. There is but a fleeting moment for the two countries to recalibrate their goals and approaches toward each other. As Mao put it in a January 1963 poem urging revolutionary action, and as Nixon famously quoted during his historic 1972 visit to China highlighting the urgent need for U.S.-Chinese engagement, “Ten thousand years are too long. Seize the day, seize the hour!”

### 5. [EU vows reforms to confront China, US -- but split on joint debt](https://www.guampdn.com/news/national/eu-vows-reforms-to-confront-china-us----but-split-on-joint-debt/article_0a0a5d53-0f86-5a20-bbcd-f88ea8db544c.html)
**Source**: Pacific Daily News | **Date**: 2026-02-12T20:40:00+00:00

> EU leaders pledged after talks Thursday to move ahead swiftly with reforms to revive Europe's flagging economy but were split on calls for joint debt to help the bloc confront twin threats from China and the United States.
> Reducing Europe's dependencies on countries outside the bloc has gained greater urgency because of geopolitical shocks, intensified global competition and an economy that lags behind bigger powers.
> Leaders agree on a common diagnosis that Europe's moribund economy needs a kickstart and had hoped a day of "brainstorming" in a castle in eastern Belgium would help them agree on the cure.
> "We share the same sense of urgency. We need to act immediately and accelerate, because we are being pushed around by international competition," French President Emmanuel Macron said after the talks.
> The discussion "brought a new energy" on building a more resilient economy, echoed EU chief Antonio Costa, promising "concrete measures" would be taken in the next leaders' meeting in March.
> "One Europe, one market," European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters, vowing to better integrate the EU's single market to unlock private capital that the bloc's companies need to scale up.
> But big divisions remained on show among the EU's 27 capitals.
> Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz sought to present a united front when arriving at the talks, but the key powers have publicly diverged on France's push to favour EU companies and for more joint debt.
> On the crucial matter of debt, the lines did not appear to have moved.
> "We have taken on European debt in exceptional situations -- but those were exceptional situations," Merz said afterwards.
> "We have to make do with the money we have," he said.
> Macron also warned that climate action should not be sacrificed on the altar of boosting the economy, saying it would be a "strategic error" to abandon it -- contrasting with Merz's strong push to slash EU red tape across all sectors.
> The French-backed "Buy European" push remained on the table after Thursday's talks, despite protectionism concerns by free trade advocates including Sweden and the Netherlands -- but with caveats.
> "On European preference, I feel that there is a broad agreement on the need to use it in the selected strategic sectors, in the proportional and targeted way," Costa said.
> The EU executive will publish a proposal this month for rules that would demand governments prioritise European-made goods in public contracts.
> Macron said the leaders would define which sectors during the March summit.
> Merz has said the EU should seek a "Made with Europe" approach rather than "Made in Europe, a message echoed by Japanese companies.
> In the latest draft seen by AFP Thursday, the commission appeared to open the door to Germany's wishes with the proposal that it would identify "trusted partners" and allow content from them to be "equivalent" to European content.
> Partners could include countries like Japan with whom the EU has a trade deal.
> The EU's list of concerns is long including lacklustre economic growth compared with its global rivals, and dependence on countries outside the bloc including China for rare earths essential for industry.
> Leaders, backed by influential European figures, believe the key to transforming the 27-country bloc's economy is to deepen the single market and make it easier for businesses to work across the continent.
> They heard from former European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi and Italian ex-premier Enrico Letta, the authors of 2024 reports guiding Europe.
> Draghi told leaders the EU must reduce barriers and mobilise Europeans' savings and backed the call for "targeted" preference for European companies, an EU official said.
> Two paths promoted by the EU to become more competitive are "simplifying" EU rules to reduce the administrative burden for businesses and striking more trade deals -- easier said than done.
> A recent trade agreement with the South American Mercosur bloc has come up against fierce opposition while changes to EU laws have been bogged down in the bloc's legislative process.
> Draghi also called for "enhanced cooperation", which would mean EU states that want to can move forward on certain reforms if the 27 states can't agree.
> Macron warned that if progress is not made on reforming the single market by June, willing EU states should move forward without others.
> The EU executive will also propose next month the creation of a new legal system for businesses outside of the scope of member states -- the so-called 28th regime -- to make it easier for companies to work across the bloc.

> French President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday cited state support for Elon Musk's Starlink as an argument for public investment in European industry, provoking a response from the world's richest man after calling him "over-subsidised".
> Speaking at an industrial summit in the Belgian city of Antwerp, Macron argued for a "Buy European" competitiveness approach, and for massive investment partly financed through joint borrowing by the European Union.
> "If you look at the US, you have a lot of private money... but you have a lot of public money" too, he said.
> "Everybody is fascinated by Starlink... But if you are lucid, Mr. Musk is probably one of the guys of the world who has had in his pockets the most... billions dollars of the American taxpayers in order to be subsidised," he added.

> The French leader earlier said that more joint EU debt was the "only way" to compete on an economic level with rivals such as the US and China.

### 2. [AVITA Medical Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2025 Financial Results](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/avita-medical-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2025-financial-results-1035822212)
**Source**: Markets Insider | **Date**: 2026-02-12T21:25:00+00:00

> VALENCIA, Calif., Feb.  12, 2026  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  AVITA Medical®, Inc. (NASDAQ: RCEL, ASX: AVH), a leading therapeutic acute wound care company delivering transformative solutions (“AVITA Medical,” or the “Company”), today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2025.
> Fourth Quarter 2025 Financial Highlights and Recent Business Updates
> Full-Year 2025 Financial Highlights
> Cary Vance, Interim Chief Executive Officer of AVITA Medical, commented:
> “The fourth quarter marked the close of a year of stabilization, and the beginning of a more execution-focused phase, for the Company. While reimbursement disruption and operational transition weighed on revenue performance in 2025, those issues are now largely behind us, and we are seeing early signs of normalization in clinician use of RECELL. We enter 2026 with a clearer commercial focus and a validated portfolio that supports growth through deeper utilization within our core burn and trauma centers, with our priority centered on delivering consistent, execution-led growth quarter by quarter.”
> David O’Toole, Chief Financial Officer, commented:
> “Throughout 2025, we took deliberate actions to reduce our operating cost base and improve cash efficiency, resulting in sequential improvement in cash use during the second half of the year and a more disciplined and sustainably lower cost structure. In January, we refinanced our existing debt under a new credit facility with Perceptive Advisors on terms better aligned with our operating trajectory. With less restrictive covenants, this new credit facility will allow the organization to focus on execution and operating discipline as we enter 2026.”
> Fourth Quarter Financial Results
> Total revenue was $17.6 million in the three months ended December 31, 2025, representing a decrease of $0.8 million, or 4%, compared to $18.4 million in the corresponding period in the prior year. The reduction in revenue was largely driven by MAC reimbursement headwinds, partially offset by increased revenue from new product launches and expanding adoption within the Company’s established markets.
> Gross profit margin was 81.2% versus 87.6% in Q4 2024, reflecting product mix and inventory-related adjustments. RECELL-only gross margin was 83.1% for the quarter. The Company shares the average sales price for Cohealyx at 50% and for PermeaDerm at 60%. Despite the positive economics of these arrangements, they result in an overall decrease in the gross margin percentage. Therefore, the product mix is expected to continue to impact the overall gross margin percentage while increasing gross profit. In addition, as the operating expenses associated with this revenue are not expected to rise significantly, this will contribute to improved operating profit on a quarterly basis.
> Total operating expenses were $24.7 million, compared to $26.1 million in Q4 2024, representing a decrease of $1.4 million or 5%. This includes a number of non-recurring costs, the largest of which was $1.2 million of one-time severance costs. The reduction from Q4 2024 reflects a $2.2 million decline in sales and marketing expenses, primarily from lower salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation, and commissions. General and administrative expenses decreased by $0.1 million, while research and development expenses increased by $0.8 million due to higher salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation, and clinical trial costs associated with the Cohealyx and PermeaDerm post-market studies.
> Other (expense) income, net was other income of $20,000, up $0.3 million from other expense of $0.3 million in Q4 2024. The $20,000 of other income reflects a non-cash gain of $0.6 million related to the change in fair value of the warrant liability, partially offset by a non-cash charge of $0.5 million from the change in fair value of the debt. In Q4 2024, other expense, net included non-cash charges of $0.7 million related to the change in fair value of the warrant liability, offset by $0.4 million in income related to the company’s investments.
> AVITA Medical demonstrated continued financial discipline in the quarter, with net cash use improving for the third consecutive quarter to approximately $5.1 million, compared to $6.2 million in Q3 and $10.1 million in Q2. The Company ended Q4 with cash and marketable securities of $18.2 million, compared to $23.3 million at the start of the quarter and $35.9 million at the end of 2024.
> Net loss was $11.6 million, or a loss of $0.38 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $11.6 million, or a loss of $0.44 per basic and diluted share, in the same period in 2024.
> Full Year 2025 Financial Results
> Total revenues increased by 11% to $71.6 million, compared to $64.3 million in the year-ended December 31, 2024. The growth in revenues was largely driven by deeper penetration within customer accounts, new accounts for the treatment of traumatic and surgical wounds and, to a lesser extent, new product launches.
> Gross profit margin was 82.1% compared to 85.8% in the corresponding period in the prior year. Note that the gross margin for RECELL products only was 84.3% for the year. The decrease in the overall gross margin percentage from the prior year was primarily caused by product mix and higher inventory reserve.
> Total operating expenses were $101.4 million, compared to $111.8 million in prior year period, representing a decrease of $10.4 million or 9%. The reduction reflects a $5.1 million decline in sales and marketing expenses, primarily from lower salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation, and commissions. General and administrative expenses decreased by $5.8 million primarily from lower salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation, while research and development expenses increased by $0.5 million due to higher salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation, and clinical trial costs associated with the Cohealyx and PermeaDerm post-market studies.
> Net loss was $48.6 million, or a loss of $1.74 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $61.8 million, or a loss of $2.39 per basic and diluted share, in the prior year.
> Credit facility with Perceptive Advisors LLC
> On January 13, 2026, AVITA Medical announced the closing of a five-year credit facility providing up to $60 million in capital from Perceptive Advisors LLC, a healthcare-focused investment firm. An initial $50 million has been funded with the option to draw an additional $10 million through the end of the first quarter of 2027, subject to meeting a certain revenue milestone. The proceeds of the transaction were used to repay the Company’s outstanding debt, with the balance to be used to support the further growth of its acute wound care portfolio.
> As part of the new credit facility, the Company established trailing twelve-month (TTM) revenue covenants aligned with its current operating trajectory. As set forth in the credit facility, the initial TTM revenue covenant is $68.5 million for the first quarter ending March 31, 2026, and $73 million for the full year 2026. Accordingly, based on the Company’s reported financial results for the three quarters ended December 31, 2025, the Company will be required to achieve only $15.4 million in revenue in the first quarter of 2026, to comply with the initial TTM revenue covenant of $68.5 million.
> AVITA Medical remains focused on disciplined cash management, sharpening execution, and accelerating commercial momentum across its core U.S. burn and trauma center opportunity.
> Webcast and Conference Call Information
> AVITA Medical will host a conference call on Thursday, February 12, 2026, at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Standard Time (Friday, February 13, 2026, at 8:30 a.m. Australian Eastern Daylight Time) to discuss its fourth quarter 2025 financial results and recent business highlights.

### 3. [Global markets hold firm despite rising geopolitical risk](https://www.moneymarketing.co.uk/global-markets-hold-firm-despite-rising-geopolitical-risk/?preview_id=714444)
**Source**: Money Marketing | **Date**: 2026-02-12T11:11:00+00:00

> Jeremy Harding, head of wealth management at Norman K., says global markets have started the year with resilience, even as geopolitical tensions resurface and volatility ticks higher.
> January saw a modest rise in market volatility amid renewed pressure from the US on Venezuela, Greenland and Iran.
> However, investor appetite for risk assets remained intact, supported by stronger-than-expected macroeconomic data. Global equities continued to advance, underpinned by a solid start to the earnings season.
> Earnings momentum was initially concentrated in technology stocks but broadened as the month progressed, lending support across a wider range of sectors. Small and mid-caps, emerging markets and Japanese equities all benefited from improving sentiment.
> Commodities also performed well, supported by higher energy prices linked to winter conditions in the northern hemisphere and ongoing geopolitical uncertainty.
> Assets traditionally seen as geopolitical hedges responded strongly. Gold rose more than 10% in January before easing in early February following the appointment of Kevin Warsh as chair of the Federal Reserve.
> European defence stocks also rallied, reflecting heightened international tensions and a growing focus on strategic autonomy.
> Bond markets remained under pressure as improved growth expectations and concerns over public deficits weighed on prices. US Treasury yields moved higher, particularly at the short end, as investors pushed back expectations for interest rate cuts.
> In Japan, government bonds suffered their weakest start to a year since 1994, driven by fiscal concerns and political uncertainty, steepening the yield curve and weakening the yen.
> Harding says the global economy is increasingly evolving towards a multipolar structure, centred on the US, China and Europe, each seeking greater strategic independence.
> James Klempster: Markets beyond the noise
> This shift reinforces the case for broader diversification across regions, currencies and commodities.
> In the US, early-year economic data surprised to the upside, supported by resilient consumption, continued momentum in artificial intelligence and solid corporate earnings.
> While the labour market shows signs of cooling and tariffs are beginning to weigh on activity, growth is still expected to remain positive. Inflation remains above target, suggesting the Federal Reserve is likely to keep rates on hold in the near term, with easing potentially considered later in the year.
> In Europe, fiscal stimulus and renewed focus on strategic autonomy could create selective opportunities, particularly if China succeeds in stabilising its economy through measures to boost domestic consumption.
> The European Central Bank is expected to remain cautious, with limited scope for further rate cuts as inflation remains close to target.
> Corporate earnings on both sides of the Atlantic should continue to support markets, but Harding cautions that high valuations, concentration risk and record levels of AI-related investment call for increased diversification.
> Against this backdrop, Norman K. maintains a balanced and selective asset allocation. Equity exposure remains neutral, with an emphasis on diversification beyond large US technology stocks.
> Gold retains a strategic role amid gradual de-dollarisation trends, while investment grade bonds in the US and Europe are favoured for their risk-return profile.
> Private debt is used selectively as an alternative to high yield, alongside continued exposure to unlisted assets for diversification. Cryptocurrencies are approached cautiously, reflecting their elevated volatility.

### 4. [US stocks wobble after feeling both the upside and downside of a strong jobs report](https://www.ocregister.com/2026/02/11/stock-market-jobs-report-boost/)
**Source**: Orange County Register | **Date**: 2026-02-12T00:52:00+00:00

> By STAN CHOE, AP Business Writer
> NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks felt both the upside and downside Wednesday of a surprisingly strong report that said the nation’s unemployment rate improved last month.
> After initially rising toward an all-time high, the S&P 500 flipped between gains and losses before finishing with a minuscule dip of less than 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 66 points, or 0.1%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.2%. Both also erased early gains.
> Treasury yields, meanwhile, remained higher in the bond market after the Labor Department said U.S. employers added 130,000 jobs to their payrolls last month, more than economists expected. That helped calm worries from a day earlier, when a discouraging report suggested spending by U.S. households, the main engine of the economy, may be stalling.
> On one hand, the strong data on jobs raises hopes that the U.S. economy can remain solid and keep driving big profits for companies. Stocks in the energy and raw-material industries jumped to some of the bigger gains in the S&P 500, for example, and their profits tend to be closely tied to the health of the economy.
> Exxon Mobil climbed 2.6%. Smurfit Westrock jumped 9.9% even though the packaging company reported a weaker profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It gave financial targets for the next five years that some analysts found encouraging.
> But on the other hand for the broad stock market, the stronger-than-expected jobs data could also keep the Federal Reserve on hold when it comes to cuts to interest rates. And higher rates can drag on prices for stocks and all kinds of other investments.
> After Wednesday’s report showed the tick down for the U.S. unemployment rate, traders pushed back their bets for when the Fed could begin cutting interest rates again, according to data from CME Group. The bets slid further into the summer, after a new Fed chair is set to take the helm.
> If Wednesday’s jobs report had shown a rise in the unemployment rate or other worsening for the job market, that could have pushed the Fed to resume its cuts more quickly.
> Lower rates would give the economy and financial markets a boost, though at the cost of potentially worsening inflation. The next monthly update on inflation at the U.S. consumer level is arriving on Friday, and it will likely be another big influence on the Fed’s plans.
> After the jobs report, the yield on the 10-year Treasury edged up to 4.17% from 4.16% late Tuesday. The two-year Treasury yield, which moves more closely with expectations for Fed moves, climbed more. It rose to 3.51% from 3.45%.
> To be sure, all is still not perfectly clear for the U.S. economy. Wednesday’s report included major revisions, which said employers added just 181,000 jobs for all of last year. That’s less than a third of the previously reported 584,000, and it’s the weakest showing for a year since 2020, when COVID-19 shut down the economy.
> The overall jobs report nevertheless looked to be an encouraging signal for the economy.
> “We all knew there would be downward revisions, but these were better than expected,” Brian Jacobsen, chief economic strategist at Annex Wealth Management, said of the markdowns for 2025.
> On Wall Street, Robinhood Markets fell 8.8% even though the trading and investment app reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Its revenue fell short of forecasts, and analysts highlighted Robinhood’s forecast for expenses in 2026, along with concerns about how long a slowdown in crypto trading will last.
> Crypto prices have plunged recently, and bitcoin’s price fell toward $67,000 Wednesday. It’s lost close to half its value since setting a record in October.
> Moderna dropped 3.5% after saying the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is refusing to consider its application for a new flu vaccine made with Nobel Prize-winning mRNA technology. It’s the latest sign of the FDA’s heightened scrutiny of vaccines under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
> Kraft Heinz recovered from an early loss and added 0.4% after CEO Steve Cahillane said he’s pausing the company’s planned split into two businesses as he tries to return it to profitable growth. He also announced a $600 million investment across marketing, sales and research and development.
> All told, the S&P 500 edged down by 0.34 to 6,941.47 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 66.74 to 50,121.40, and the Nasdaq composite fell 36.01 to 23,066.47.
> In stock markets abroad, indexes were mixed in Europe following a better showing in Asia.
> The United Kingdom’s FTSE 100 gained 1.1%, and South Korea’s Kospi rose 1% for two of the bigger moves.

> Furthermore, copper is vital to artificial intelligence and the

>             centers is causing an explosion in electricity demand, requiring
>             substantial copper for new infrastructure and power transmission.
> This all boils down to everything driving the world’s

> While the copper market was roughly balanced in 2025, meaning that

>               (IISS).
> A significant long-term deficit is projected, potentially exceeding
>             6 million tonnes annually by the early 2030s. Total output from
>             copper mines in 2025 was 23 million tonnes, according to the
>             USGS.
> Google AI identified key trends in copper supply in 2026:
> A new study released on Jan. 8 by S&P Global Market Intelligence and
>             S&P Global Energy found that copper supply is expected to fall
>             10Mt short of demand by 2040, putting at risk industries such as
>             artificial intelligence, defense spending and electrification.
> The shortage would be 23.8% shy of the projected demand of 42Mt,
>             even as copper recycling doubles to 10Mt. AOTH research has found
>             that copper supply has not been able to meet demand without
>             recycling for the past several years.
> “Here, in short, is the quandary: copper is the great
>                 enabler of electrification, but the accelerating pace of
>                 electrification is an increasing challenge for copper,”
>                 Daniel Yergin, vice chairman at S&P Global, who co-chaired
>                 the study, said in a statement. “Economic demand, grid

> Without significant changes to supply, global copper production is
>             projected to peak at 33Mt in 2030 before declining, while demand is
>             expected to surge 50% from current levels, according to the study.
> An additional 10Mt of primary supply will be required by 2040. But
>             without significant investment, primary production could reach just
>             22Mt, a million tonnes below current levels.
> Among the supply constraints identified by the report are declining
>             ore grades, rising energy and labor costs, complex extraction
>             conditions and lengthy permitting times. The average timeline from discovery to production spans 17

> Supply chain concentration adds another layer of risk, says S&P

>             vulnerable to supply shocks and trade barriers, the report
>             said.
> An earlier (November 2025) blog post by Wood Mackenzie brings its forecast five years ahead of S&P Global, with
