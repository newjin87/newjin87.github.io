### 3. [Oil Steady as Traders Brace for US-Iran Nuclear Talks](https://english.aawsat.com/business/5241280-oil-steady-traders-brace-us–iran-nuclear-talks)
**Source**: Asharq Al-Awsat | **Date**: 2026-02-16T06:00:00+00:00

> Oil traded little changed on Monday, with investors weighing the market implications of upcoming US-Iran talks aimed at de-escalating tensions against a backdrop of expected OPEC+ supply increases.
> Brent crude futures edged up 3 cents to $67.78 a barrel by 0358 GMT.
> US West Texas Intermediate crude was at $62.91 a barrel, up 2 cents. There will be no WTI settlement on Monday due to a US holiday, said Reuters.
> Last week, both benchmarks posted ‌weekly declines with ‌Brent settling down about 0.5% and WTI losing 1% ‌after ⁠comments from US President ⁠Donald Trump that Washington could make a deal with Tehran over the next month drove down prices on Thursday.
> The two countries due to hold a second round of talks in Geneva on Tuesday after renewing negotiations earlier this month aimed at tackling their decades-long dispute over Tehran's nuclear program and averting a new military confrontation.
> Iran is pursuing a nuclear agreement with the US that delivers economic benefits ⁠for both sides, with energy and mining investments and aircraft ‌purchases up for discussion, an Iranian diplomat ‌was reported as saying on Sunday.
> "With both sides expected to hold firm on their ‌core red lines, expectations are low that a deal can be reached ‌and this is likely to be the calm before the storm," IG market analyst Tony Sycamore said.
> The US has dispatched a second aircraft carrier to the region and is preparing for the possibility of a sustained military campaign if the talks do not succeed, ‌US officials have told Reuters. Iran's Revolutionary Guards have warned that in case of strikes on Iranian territory, they ⁠could retaliate against any ⁠US military base.
> With US-Iran tensions pushing up oil prices, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies - together called OPEC+ - are leaning toward resuming output increases from April following a three-month halt, to meet peak summer demand, Reuters reported.
> Activity in global financial markets is expected to be muted on Monday with China, South Korea and Taiwan closed for Lunar New Year holidays, in addition to Presidents Day in the United States.
> "With Chinese demand cues largely absent this week, liquidity remains thin and price action could stay erratic," said Sugandha Sachdeva, founder of SS WealthStreet, a New Delhi-based research firm.
> In the near term, geopolitical developments and inventory data will remain the primary drivers of volatility, keeping crude vulnerable to sharp two-way swings, Sachdeva added.
> Moroccan grains traders and millers expect Morocco to double its cereals harvest this season after abundant winter rains, with limited impact from floods in the northwestern plains of the North African country, which is a major grains importer.
> Industry leaders plan to add domestic wheat to strategic reserves this year "without compromising imports", said Moulay Abdelkader Alaoui, head of the federation of industrial millers FNM, who expects a domestic harvest of 6 million metric tons.
> "We expect a good cereals harvest this year of 8 to 9 million tons, including around 5 million tons of soft wheat," Omar Yacoubi, head of Morocco's wheat trading federation FNCL, told Reuters. The previous harvest was 4.4 million tons, including 2.4 million tons of soft wheat.
> Morocco traditionally cancels its wheat import subsidy and reinstates customs duties to protect the local harvest.
> But this year importers, millers and traders have asked the government to extend the subsidy window to June 1, instead of May 1, to compensate for costs incurred due to bad weather.
> Rainfall this winter was 34% above the 30-year average and triple the previous year's levels, while dam filling rates improved to 70% from about 25%, agriculture ministry data shows, while the total grain-planted area rose to 3.7 million hectares, from 2.6 million the year before.
> Flooding in the fertile northwestern plains, which destroyed 110,000 hectares, had a "localized" impact, Yacoubi said, with wheat losses to be offset by higher yields in larger plains.
> Large swells and storms since mid-December have disrupted port operations at Casablanca and Jorf Lasfar, which handle 80% of Morocco's wheat imports.
> Shipping delays have weighed heavily on importers, even as international wheat prices remain below the subsidy eligibility threshold, Yacoubi said, adding that as of this week, 70 ships carrying 1 million tons of wheat were queued outside ports, leading to low stock levels.
> Moroccan importers are paying about $20,000 per day for ships waiting offshore, pushing them to request an extension of the government subsidy programme.
> Traditionally, only half of Morocco's harvest reaches industrial mills because small farmers retain wheat for their own use, but Alaoui said this year's plentiful rainfall should improve crop quality and encourage more collection.
> French exporters expect to supply about two-thirds of Morocco's soft wheat import needs, or 3.5 million tons.
> From June 2025 to January 2026, Morocco imported 7 million tons of grains, up 12% year-on-year, including 3.2 million tons of soft wheat.
> During the same period, France topped Morocco's soft wheat suppliers with 2.26 million tons, followed by Argentina with 233,144 tons, Russia with 227,070 tons, Germany with 120,084 tons and the U.S. with 94,688 tons.
> Saudi Arabia’s annual inflation eased noticeably in January, rising 1.8 percent year on year, the slowest pace since February last year, signaling positive momentum for the domestic economy.
> According to official data, inflation in January 2026 was driven mainly by higher housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuel prices, which rose 4.2 percent. Transport costs increased 1.5 percent, while restaurant and accommodation services rose 1 percent.
> Housing rents remain the largest contributor to inflation, with actual rents climbing 5.2 percent annually.
> Economists said January’s slowdown points to greater price stability and easing living costs, reflecting government measures to support growth.
> Osama bin Ghanem Al-Obaidi, an advisor and professor of international commercial law, said the 1.8 percent annual rate is the lowest among G20 countries. While housing and utilities remain the largest contributors, he noted that rent increases are now less intense than in recent months.
> Al-Obaidi added that inflation control in Saudi Arabia remains effective, with relative price stability supporting consumer purchasing power and easing pressure on low-income households. He said January’s data reflects growing market stability, with pressures in some categories contained by demand.
> Economist Ahmed Al-Shahri, for his part, noted that the moderation in inflation boosts confidence and encourages investment and broader economic activity. He attributed the improvement to government efforts to ensure economic stability and advance sustainable development, underscoring the effectiveness of fiscal and economic policies.
> Al-Shahri highlighted housing and rental measures introduced under the direction of Crown Prince and Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman, noting their significant impact. Despite the 1.8 percent annual rise, he said inflation remains low by historical standards, indicating that price pressures are gradually easing after post-pandemic global shocks and supply-chain disruptions.
> Transport prices rose 1.5 percent year on year, driven by a 6 percent increase in passenger transport services. Restaurant and accommodation prices increased 1 percent, reflecting higher food and beverage services. Personal care and other goods and services surged 7.9 percent, led by higher jewelry and watch prices. Insurance and financial services rose 3.3 percent, while food and beverages edged up 0.2 percent.
> Furniture and household equipment prices fell 0.3 percent, and health prices dipped 0.1 percent.
> On a monthly basis, the consumer price index rose 0.2 percent in January compared with December 2025, supported by higher housing, transport and restaurant prices, while food and beverages declined 0.6 percent.
> Gold prices dropped on Monday, pressured by thin trading volumes as US and China markets remained shut due to local public holidays, while some traders booked profits after last session's 2.5% jump.
> Spot gold fell 1.1% to $4,986.32 per ounce by 0550 GMT. US gold futures for April delivery lost 0.8% to $5,005.60 per ounce.
> "Gold has given back some of Friday's post-CPI ‌gains today due to ‌thinner trading conditions and a lack ‌of ⁠fresh upside catalysts," said ⁠Tim Waterer, KCM chief analyst, referring to the US consumer price inflation data. He also pointed to profit-taking on the day.
> US markets are closed for the Presidents' Day holiday, while markets in China are closed for the Lunar New Year holiday. The US CPI rose 0.2% in January after an unrevised 0.3% gain in December, ⁠the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said ‌on Friday.
> Economists polled by Reuters ‌had forecast the CPI to increase by 0.3%. Federal Reserve Bank of ‌Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on Friday that interest rates could ‌go down, but noted that services inflation remained high.
> Market participants anticipate the central bank to hold interest rates at its next meeting on March 18. Still, they are pricing in 75 basis points in rate ‌cuts this year, with the first expected in July, according to data compiled by LSEG.
> Non-yielding ⁠bullion tends ⁠to do well in low-interest-rate environments. "It will likely require the dollar to resume its downtrend for gold to make a push in the direction of $6,000 before year-end," Waterer said.
> On the geopolitical front, the US military is preparing for the possibility of a weeks-long operation against Iran should President Donald Trump authorize an attack, two US officials told Reuters, in what could become a far more serious conflict than previously seen between the countries.
> Spot silver lost 2.4% to $75.64 per ounce, after a 3% fall earlier in the session. The white metal rose 3.4% on Friday. Spot platinum slipped 0.8% to $2,045.11 per ounce, while palladium shed 0.7% to $1,673.52.

### 4. [Iran foreign minister met IAEA chief ahead of nuclear talks](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/iran-us-iaea-nuclear-watchdog-talks-military-5934951)

> Iranian Foreign Minister meets with International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General in Geneva, Switzerland, Feb 16, 2026. (Photo: REUTERS/Iranian Foreign Ministry/WANA (West Asia News Agency))
> DUBAI: Iran's foreign minister met with the UN nuclear watchdog chief on Monday (Feb 16), ahead of talks between Washington and Tehran aimed at resolving a nuclear dispute, with few clear signs of compromise from either side and the threat of US military action looming.
> Washington, which joined Israel in a wave of air strikes on Iran in June, has ordered a second aircraft carrier group to the Middle East in the latest standoff with Tehran, in addition to other US warships and aircraft that have already been deployed.
> Adding to the tension, Iran began a military drill on Monday in the Strait of Hormuz, a vital international waterway and oil export route from Gulf Arab states, who have been appealing for diplomacy to end the dispute.
> The US and Iran renewed negotiations earlier this month hoping to tackle their decades-long dispute over Tehran's nuclear programme, which Washington, other Western states and Israel all believe is aimed at building nuclear arms. Tehran denies this.
> Oil prices were little changed on Monday, with investors weighing the market implications of upcoming US-Iran talks aimed at de-escalating frictions against a backdrop of expected OPEC+ supply increases.
> However, Washington has sought to expand the scope of talks to non-nuclear issues such as Iran's missile stockpile. Tehran says it is only willing to discuss curbs on its nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief and won't accept zero uranium enrichment. It says its missile capabilities are off the table.
> Speaking during a visit to Hungary on Monday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said reaching a deal with Tehran would be hard.
> "I think that there's an opportunity here to diplomatically reach an agreement that addresses the things we're concerned about. We'll be very open and welcoming to that. But I don't want to overstate it either. It's going to be hard. It's been very difficult for anyone to do real deals with Iran, because we're dealing with radical Shia clerics who are making theological decisions, not geopolitical ones."
> Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said he was in Geneva to "achieve a fair and equitable deal".
> "What is not on the table: submission before threats," Araqchi said on X.
> Iran has repeatedly threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz in retaliation against any attack, which would choke a fifth of global oil flows and send crude prices sharply higher.
> The waterway connects the biggest Gulf oil producers, such as Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates, with the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea.
> Iran's Revolutionary Guards have conducted a drill named "Smart Control of the Strait of Hormuz", to test the readiness of the guards' naval units to protect the waterway, the semi-official Tasnim news agency said on Monday.
> "Intelligently utilising the geopolitical advantages of the Islamic Republic in the Persian Gulf and the Sea of Oman are among the main objectives of this exercise," Tasnim said.
> Iran's civil defence organisation held a chemical defence drill in the Pars Special Economic Energy Zone on Monday to strengthen preparedness for potential chemical incidents in the energy hub located in southern Iran.
> Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi on Sunday signalled Iran's readiness to compromise on its nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief, telling the BBC that the ball was "in America's court to prove that they want to do a deal."
> Prior to the US joining Israel in striking Iranian nuclear sites in June, Iran-US nuclear talks had stalled over Washington's demand that Tehran forgo enrichment on its soil, which the US views as a pathway to an Iranian nuclear weapon.
> Iran says its nuclear programme is solely for civilian purposes and is ready to assuage concerns regarding nuclear weapons by "building trust that enrichment is and will stay for peaceful purposes."
> Iran's Foreign Ministry said Araqchi had discussed cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency, as well as Tehran's technical point of view regarding nuclear talks with the US during his meeting with IAEA head Rafael Grossi.
> The IAEA has been calling on Iran for months to say what happened to its stockpile of 440 kg (970 pounds) of highly enriched uranium following Israeli-US strikes and let inspections fully resume, including in three key sites that were bombed in June last year: Natanz, Fordow and Isfahan.
> Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday he told US President Donald Trump last week that any US deal with Iran must include the dismantling of Iran's nuclear infrastructure, not just stopping the enrichment process.
> Netanyahu said he is sceptical of a deal but it must include enriched material leaving Iran. "There shall be no enrichment capability - not stopping the enrichment process, but dismantling the equipment and the infrastructure that allows you to enrich in the first place," he said.

> In a world defined by volatility and uncertainty, building disciplined, well-balanced portfolios is key to compounding wealth. At the Mint Money Festival 2026, investment and personal finance experts shared practical insights on managing money and investing wisely.
> Saugata Chatterjee, president and chief business officer, Nippon Life Asset Management, in a presentation, explained why asset allocation, not prediction, remains the most reliable strategy for long-term investors.
> Living with VUCAIn his presentation, ‘Your Money Playbook: Asset allocation beats stock tips,’ Chatterjee said that volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity (VUCA) are not new to markets. “They were present ten years ago, twenty years ago, and they will remain part and parcel of our investing lives."
>       The world today, he said, is shaped by VUCA at every level—economic, political, geopolitical, and even geo-economic. “Everything we read in newspapers, everything we see on the market screen, eventually comes back to these four forces."

> There are many reasons why volatility in the fixed income (bond) market can be expected to continue for the remainder of 2026. Indeed, we’ve only just kicked off the year, and the amount of volatility we’ve already seen to start 2026 has been notable.
> I think most of this volatility comes from the reality that market participants of all sizes are seeing mixed signals from hard and soft indicators. Whether we’re talking about the jobs market, the U.S. dollar, inflation or GDP growth, each and every monthly report brings plenty of head-scratching. Personally, I’m not necessarily a fan of the near-term moves we’re seeing in rates, but the direction does seem to want to trend lower.
> Here’s why I think that’s the best bet to make this year for those considering adding some fixed income exposure to their portfolios in 2026.
> Let’s start with the jobs market for a second. That’s the most important factor I think the Federal Reserve is likely to be focused on for the remainder of the year, considering the material weakness we’re now seeing in most areas of the economy. Outside of healthcare and some pockets of the construction and hospitality industry (which are still somewhat recovering from the pandemic), it’s pretty much red across the board every print.
> And given the surging layoff announcements we’re seeing (with plenty coming from the healthcare sector as well in recent months), I think these job gains are going to turn into losses in short order. On a population adjusted basis, the U.S. isn’t adding enough jobs for the new workers entering the workforce. Additionally, given the cost of living constraints facing many seniors, I think a return to the job market for older folks could exacerbate an already-precarious situation for all workers and make these numbers look worse in the coming months in terms of the overall unemployment rate (which factors in the participation rate).
> If the Fed leans more toward saving jobs (thanks to other risks such as AI as well) instead of battling inflation – after all, inflation isn’t anything to worry about if no one has a job – then we could be due for a much lower interest rate at the front end of the curve than many expect. I’d anticipate this could bleed into the longer end of the curve, particularly if investors think these rates will stay lower for longer, once again.
> The word inflation on a calculator on top of a stack of $100 bills
> The other scenario I think most market participants are not factoring in right now is the idea that disinflationary pressures that have pushed overall inflation from around 9% in 2022 to around 2.4% today (quite close to the Federal Reserve’s target of 2%) could actually be at risk of overshooting the 2% target.
> One of the key reasons why this may take place is a sudden loss of faith in the U.S. market’s growth potential. Much of the recent GDP growth we’ve seen has been tied directly to AI investment. If that investment slows, as companies look to shore up their margins and reduce Capex, that could provide recessionary forces that may lead to a self-fulfilling doom loop. We haven’t seen any real indications of this yet, but that’s something I’m keeping my eye on.
> The other key factor I don’t think gets enough attention is the reality that housing costs make up more than a third of CPI overall (and a very large chunk of GDP growth as well). If housing costs continue to come down as rents and mortgage payments decline (and property values decline as well, still the leading cause of unaffordability for new home buyers), this could lead to a sharp downturn in CPI which could force the Fed’s hand.
> Now, I should point out that these factors are only starting to potentially rear their heads, and we’ll have to see the extent to which housing prices come down in the years to come, and if AI spending slows. But these are the two main factors I think could lead to a diminished inflation environment (regardless of tariff/trade policy) that investors aren’t paying close enough attention to.

### 5. [Finding anti-fragile portfolio in AI era](https://www.thehansindia.com/business/finding-anti-fragile-portfolio-in-ai-era-1048821)
**Source**: The Hans India | **Date**: 2026-02-16T05:57:00+00:00

> The pertinent questions-will AI create entirely new markets? Which industries will next face obsolescence? Which companies will emerge as architects of this new reality?
> The most striking symptom of this fragile investment environment is the pressure being exerted on the market’s traditional stalwarts: the cash-rich, stable, blue-chip companies
> Themarket presents a curious paradox. On the surface, it is directionless, lacking a clear trend or a decisive narrative. Yet beneath this placid surface, a powerful undercurrent of volatility has been unleashed. The source of this turbulence is not the usual suspects of interest rates or geopolitical strife, but something more fundamental and unsettling - the relentless march of technological disruption, specifically the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI).
> The equity markets are grappling with a phenomenon that is, as of now, poorly defined. While the "first order" effects of AI are becoming painfully clear, viz., the direct challenge it poses to the established business models of the IT services industry - the subsequent ripples, the "next order" effects, remain shrouded in fog. Will AI create entirely new markets? Which industries will be the next to face obsolescence? Which companies will emerge as the architects of this new reality? For now, the answers are frustratingly opaque.
> And as any seasoned investor knows, markets abhor uncertainty above all else. This ambiguity is a poison pill for investor sentiment. In the absence of clarity, the human mind, prone to cognitive biases, begins to extrapolate the worst-case scenario. A vague threat to a specific sector, morphs into a systemic risk for the entire ecosystem. This fear is not confined to speculative growth stocks but has leached into the very bedrock of the market.
> The most striking symptom of this fragile investment environment is the pressure being exerted on the market's traditional stalwarts: the cash-rich, stable, blue-chip companies. For decades, these corporations have been the port in any storm, the "safe haven" for risk-averse capital. Investors parked their money there, comforted by the predictability of their earnings and the resilience of their business models. But AI has rendered their prospects indistinct, the ‘save heaven’ is being unraveled. The fear is no longer about a bad quarter or a missed earnings estimate. It is a deeper, existential worry: is this business model relevant in a world of artificial general intelligence (AGI)? Will their decades of accumulated data and industry expertise become a defensible moat or a stranded asset?
> Consequently, even these bluest of chips are bleeding investments. The capital that once sought refuge in their stability is now questioning whether that stability is an illusion. The ground has shifted, and the pillars that were once considered immovable are now showing cracks. This has sent a shockwave through the investment community, forcing a fundamental rethink of portfolio construction.
> As the environment turns increasingly fragile, investors are desperately seeking a new paradigm. They are pondering the creation of portfolios that are not just robust, not just able to withstand a shock, but are, in the words of author Nassim Nicholas Taleb, "anti-fragile."
> The concept is seductive. An anti-fragile system is one that gains from volatility, shocks, and disorder. It doesn't just survive the fire; it emerges from it stronger. In the context of an AI-disrupted world, an anti-fragile portfolio wouldn't just protect capital; it would thrive on the very chaos that is toppling others. It would be structured to benefit from the "next order" effects, whatever they may be. This quest for the unbreakable leads to the critical, and perhaps unanswerable, question that hangs over every investment committee and individual portfolio manager today: Is there anything truly anti-fragile?
> Perhaps the answer lies not in finding a single, mythical asset class that is immune to disruption, but in a different approach to structure. True anti-fragility might be found in a barbell strategy i.e., on one end, hyper-conservative assets (cash, short-term government bonds, even gold) that provide a floor, and on the other, a calculated portfolio of high-conviction, speculative bets on the very technologies causing the disruption. The middle, the traditional blue-chip growth stock, is precisely where the fragility is most acute.
> Or perhaps anti-fragility is a mindset, not a portfolio. It is the acceptance that the future is inherently unknowable. It is the discipline of avoiding the fatal error of extrapolating the worst, while simultaneously preparing for a multitude of outcomes. It is the understanding that in a world being rewritten by AI, the only true hedge is the adaptability to recognize the "next order" effects not as they are forecast, but as they unfold. The market's current turmoil is a stark reminder that in times of profound technological shift, there are no permanent safe havens. The search for the anti-fragile portfolio may ultimately be a search for a mirage. But the pursuit itself—the rigorous questioning of established truths and the humble acknowledgment of uncertainty—is the only practice that can prevent investors from being broken by the waves of change they cannot control. Investors should also realize that their health is the most fragile and ensure that they take good care of it during these tumultuous times.

> Asian stock markets traded in a tight range on Monday as a week-long Lunar New Year holiday in China reduced regional trading volumes, while weak Japanese GDP data pressured Tokyo equities. Market participation was further subdued with South Korea, Taiwan, and U.S. markets closed for holidays, leading to cautious investor sentiment across the region.
> Japan’s Nikkei 225 slipped 0.2%, and the broader TOPIX index declined 0.8% after fourth-quarter economic growth figures fell significantly short of expectations. Japan’s GDP expanded just 0.2% year-on-year in Q4, well below the 1.6% forecast, highlighting continued economic fragility. The data reflected weak business investment, softer export demand, and sluggish private consumption. Although Tokyo introduced stimulus measures in late 2025, their impact on growth appeared limited.
> Despite the disappointing GDP report, losses in Japanese stocks were somewhat contained amid expectations that Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi may introduce additional fiscal stimulus to bolster the economy. The weaker growth outlook also tempered expectations for further Bank of Japan interest rate hikes, even as inflation remained relatively sticky during the quarter.
> In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index edged up 0.3% in light trading. CMOC Group and Laopu Gold surged roughly 6% each after being added to the Hang Seng Index, while battery manufacturer CATL advanced 2.5% on similar news. Conversely, Zhongsheng Group Holdings declined 2% following its removal from the benchmark index.
> Elsewhere in Asia-Pacific markets, Australia’s ASX 200 gained 0.2%, while Singapore’s Straits Times Index dipped 0.1% after weaker-than-expected non-oil export data for January. India’s Nifty 50 futures fell 0.4%, extending concerns over artificial intelligence-driven disruptions in the IT sector, which had already pushed the index down 1.3% on Friday.

### 2. [Emerging Market - Asian FX steady in thin holiday trade; Thai stocks climb to over one‑year high](https://www.thestar.com.my/aseanplus/aseanplus-news/2026/02/16/emerging-market---asian-fx-steady-in-thin-holiday-trade-thai-stocks-climb-to-over-oneyear-high)
**Source**: The Star | **Date**: 2026-02-16T10:46:00+00:00

> SOUTH-EAST ASIA (Reuters): Asian currencies hovered in narrow ranges on Monday, as holiday-thinned trading kept movements subdued, while regional equities edged lower in the absence of strong market cues, even as Thai shares jumped to their highest level since December 2024.
> With markets in China, South Korea, Taiwan, the United States and Indonesia closed for holidays, activity was subdued across the region, leaving most currencies and equities largely becalmed.
> Among the few actively traded units, the Malaysian ringgit and the Thai baht edged 0.2% higher.
> The ringgit has strengthened in four of the past five sessions and is the region's best-performing currency so far this year, with Malaysian assets drawing global inflows as a softer U.S. dollar and rising geopolitical tensions encourage diversification.
> The rest of the traded currencies in the region stayed largely flat. On the equities front, Thai stocks rose as much as 1.2% to their highest level since December 2024. The benchmark index, however, pared some of its gains to trade 0.5% higher.
> The market was building on its strongest weekly performance since mid-2025, supported by a decisive election outcome that lifted investor confidence.
> The rally was driven by renewed foreign inflows as optimism strengthened over a clearer political outlook and the prospect of fresh economic stimulus measures, said Ratasak Piriyanont, senior vice-president for investment strategy at Bangkok-based Kasikorn Securities.
> Earlier in the day, data showed Thailand's economy grew faster than expected in the fourth quarter of 2025 from a year earlier.
> Shivaan Tandon, Asia economist at Capital Economics, struck a cautious tone and said momentum in the Thai economy would not likely persist into 2026.
> "The recent election outcome should reduce near-term political risk, it does little to improve an otherwise challenging economic outlook."
> Elsewhere in the region, Philippine stocks shed as much as nearly 1%, touching their lowest levels since early February, pressured by declines in key index constituents.
> Shares of renewable power company Alternergy Holdings declined as much as 2.5%, dropping to their lowest level since November 12 following its earnings release earlier in the day.
> Malaysian stocks dipped as much as 0.4% to touch their lowest levels since February 6, weighed down by benchmark constituent 99 Speed Mart Retail, which came under pressure after reporting its quarterly results late on Friday.
> Looking ahead, investors will focus on key data releases this week, including two central bank meetings scheduled for Thursday. Bank Indonesia (BI) and the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) are both set to announce their policy decisions on February 19. -- Reuters

### 3. [Emerging markets to triumph in 2026](https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/general/3198658/emerging-markets-to-triumph-in-2026)
**Source**: Bangkok Post | **Date**: 2026-02-16T18:01:00+00:00

> 2026 is expected to see a decisive rotation in global asset allocation, with emerging markets (EM) positioned to outperform developed markets (DM) as the US dollar enters a weakening cycle, according to analysts.
> Kevin Lin, managing director and head of Hong Kong and Southeast Asia Intermediary Business at Invesco, said historical data shows a clear pattern that non-US assets, particularly EM equities, tend to deliver their strongest returns during periods of dollar depreciation.
> On average, EM equities have gained nearly 8% per quarter when the dollar weakens, compared with negative returns during periods of dollar strength. Similar trends are observed across commodities, gold and global bonds outside the US, reinforcing the case for international diversification, he told an investment seminar hosted by Krungsri (Bank of Ayudhya).
> Krungsri Research projects that EMs will outperform DMs in 2026, driven by three structural factors, led by a softer dollar which historically supports capital inflows into emerging economies and strengthens local currencies.
> Secondly, valuations remain attractive as EM equities, particularly in Asia and China, are trading below long-term historical averages on a cyclically adjusted price-earnings basis. Finally, macro conditions are stabilising, with inflation easing and growth dynamics improving across several Asian economies.
> "Within emerging markets, Asia stands out. China and Hong Kong are seen as key beneficiaries," it pointed out.
> Southbound investment flows into Hong Kong equities have accelerated, while China's household deposits have climbed to record highs, indicating substantial domestic liquidity that could rotate into equity markets, Krungsri noted, saying that this liquidity backdrop is viewed as both technical and structural support for Chinese equities.
> For Thailand, Krungsri expects economic growth in 2026 to remain modest at slightly above 2%, below long-term potential and regional peers. Structural constraints, including high household debt and demographic pressures, continue to weigh on the outlook.
> However, government stimulus, tourism recovery and foreign direct investment inflows tied to supply chain diversification may provide selective investment opportunities.
> Overall, Krungsri's 2026 strategy centres on positioning portfolios for a cyclical shift away from US dominance toward EMs, particularly Asia and China, while maintaining diversified DM exposure to manage risk in a volatile global environment.
> While increasing exposure to EMs, Krungsri has maintained diversified core allocations to DMs to manage volatility.
> US equities continue to benefit from fiscal stimulus and artificial intelligence-driven growth themes. However, elevated valuations and market concentration risks suggest more balanced positioning.
> The bank favours selective exposure to DMs outside the US, where valuations are relatively more reasonable and earnings growth could broaden if global growth stabilises.
> For fixed income, Krungsri prefers short-duration instruments and selectively favours EM local bonds, which typically benefit from a weaker dollar and stable inflation trends. Investment-grade credit remains attractive, while high-yield bonds offer limited spread compensation.
> Industrial metals could gain from improving global growth and infrastructure demand, particularly under a weaker dollar scenario. Gold remains supported by central bank purchases, though the upside may moderate if geopolitical tensions ease.
> Private credit continues to offer attractive income opportunities, while cryptocurrencies are expected to move broadly in line with global risk assets.
> According to Krungsri, key risks to monitor include a sharper-than-expected global slowdown, inflation resurgence, political instability in Europe, and potential challenges to US Federal Reserve independence. In a downside scenario, DM sovereign bonds and the dollar could outperform.

> Japan’s economy expanded at a much slower pace than expected in the fourth quarter of 2025, as weak business investment and soft exports weighed heavily on overall growth. According to official government data released Monday, Japan’s gross domestic product (GDP) increased just 0.2% year-on-year in the three months ending December 31, falling significantly short of market forecasts for 1.6%. The reading marked only a modest recovery from the 2.3% contraction recorded in the third quarter, which was the steepest decline in two years.
> On a quarterly basis, Japan’s GDP rose 0.1%, also missing expectations of 0.4%. The primary drag came from capital expenditure, a key measure of business spending, which climbed only 0.2% in Q4 compared to projections of 0.8%. Sluggish corporate investment highlights ongoing uncertainty in the Japanese economy.
> External demand, reflecting exports, showed no growth during the quarter as U.S. trade tariffs and escalating diplomatic tensions with China hurt Japan’s export-driven sectors. Chinese consumers reportedly boycotted Japanese goods and avoided travel to Japan following controversial remarks by Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi regarding potential military intervention in Taiwan. Meanwhile, private consumption, another critical pillar of economic growth, edged up just 0.1%, underscoring subdued domestic demand.
> Inflationary pressures remained elevated, with the GDP price index rising 3.4%, slightly above expectations of 3.2%. Persistent inflation combined with weak economic activity complicates the outlook for the Bank of Japan, which raised interest rates by 25 basis points in January and signaled that further policy tightening will depend on growth and inflation trends.
> The disappointing GDP data increases the likelihood of additional fiscal stimulus. With her ruling coalition securing a supermajority in Japan’s lower house, Takaichi is expected to push for expanded economic support measures, including tax breaks, fiscal payouts, and potentially a supplementary budget in early fiscal 2026 to bolster Japan’s fragile recovery.

### 5. [Thailand raises growth outlook in boost to new government](https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/international/asean/thailand-raises-growth-outlook-boost-new-government)
**Source**: The Business Times | **Date**: 2026-02-16T04:13:00+00:00

> GDP in the three months through December rises 2.5% from a year earlier
> [BANGKOK] Thailand upgraded its growth projections for 2026 as the new government counts on a resurgence in exports and tourism to sustain momentum from a better-than-expected performance last quarter.
> Gross domestic product (GDP) in the three months through December rose 2.5 per cent from a year earlier, the National Economic and Social Development Council (NESDC) said on Monday (Feb 16). That exceeded the highest estimate of 1.9 per cent in a Bloomberg News survey and the 1.2 per cent pace recorded in the third quarter.
> On a quarter-on-quarter basis, the economy expanded 1.9 per cent, marking the largest jump in four years to beat the forecast of 0.6 per cent growth.
> Full-year growth stood at 2.4 per cent, prompting the NESDC to raise its outlook for 2026 economic growth to between 1.5 per cent and 2.5 per cent, from the 1.2 per cent to 2.2 per cent projected earlier.
> The benchmark SET Index rose as much as 1.2 per cent to 1,447.68, then pared gains. The Thai baht edged 0.2 per cent higher to 31.015 per US dollar, in line with most emerging-market peers. The move may have been tempered by thin liquidity, with most major Asian centres, including China, closed for the Chinese New Year holiday.
> The latest GDP data should boost Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul, whose party secured a stronger-than-expected election result and sealed a coalition deal last week. Anutin has pledged to focus on the economy and cost-of-living pressures, including measures to support households and employment.
> Get the insights delivered to your inbox.
> The NESDC said that easing trade restrictions should lift goods exports this year, while a recovery in tourism would support services exports. Total goods and services exports are projected to expand 2.1 per cent, slowing from 9.2 per cent in 2025 but up from a previous forecast of 1.1 per cent.
> Meanwhile, private consumption should continue firming due to low inflation and loose monetary policy, the NESDC noted. Headline inflation, which has been negative for the past 10 months, is expected to average between -0.3 per cent to 0.7 per cent in 2026.
> The Bank of Thailand (BOT) in December cut the benchmark interest rate for the fifth time since October 2024, to 1.25 per cent, to support the fragile economy. Policymakers will convene again on Feb 25 for their first meeting of the year. Economists in a Bloomberg survey expect the BOT to cut the key rate this quarter and then pause.
> Two decades of political instability have turned Thailand from an aspiring economy to a regional laggard beset with stagnant growth, soaring debt, widening inequality and a shrinking workforce. Its annual growth rate of about 2 per cent a year is less than half the pace of Malaysia and Singapore and barely a quarter of the growth in Vietnam.
> However, Thailand saw an uptick last quarter as the government’s stimulus helped spur consumption and investment, NESDC chief Danucha Pichayanan told a news briefing on Monday. The run-up to the vote this month also increased spending, he added.
> Investment grew 8.1 per cent in the fourth quarter, up from 1.4 per cent in the third quarter. Household consumption expanded 3.3 per cent, while government consumption rebounded from a contraction in Q3 to grow 1.3 per cent from October to December.
> Thailand now joins the regional wave of upside growth surprises, according to OCBC. Neighbours Singapore and Malaysia also performed better than expected in 2025, shaking off the impact of higher US tariffs as the boom in artificial intelligence (AI) boosted demand for their electronics.
> The Thai economy is emerging from its slump, Finance Minister Ekniti Nitithanprapas told reporters on Monday. The quick formation of the government and the steady rollout of investment should help lift GDP to at least 2 per cent this year, he said. The government’s “high target” is growth above 3 per cent, he added.
> NESDC chief Danucha said that political uncertainty after the election that disrupts preparations for the fiscal year beginning Oct 1 would pose a risk. “If the government can come into office by early April, the Budget next year may be slightly delayed by two months. If it takes a longer time than that, it will lead to further delays and that will affect the economy,” Danucha added.
> Capital Economics was less optimistic, saying the economy faces cyclical and structural challenges, including limited fiscal space and high household debt. The country also produces relatively few goods tied to the global AI upswing.
> “Overall, despite a quarter of broad-based strength, we expect growth to soften again,” economist Shivaan Tandon said in a note, adding Thailand is expected to remain “a regional underperformer” this year. BLOOMBERG

### 2. [Understanding Precious Metals as Financial Assets: Key Considerations for Today's Sellers](https://www.tennessean.com/press-release/story/143167/understanding-precious-metals-as-financial-assets-key-considerations-for-todays-sellers/)
**Source**: The Tennessean | **Date**: 2026-02-16T17:05:00+00:00

> METAIRIE, LA, UNITED STATES, February 10, 2026 /EINPresswire.com/ — Precious metals such as gold, silver, platinum, and palladium have long functioned as stores of value, mediums of exchange, and components of personal wealth strategies. In today’s economic environment, these metals continue to be viewed not only as collectible or industrial materials, but also as financial assets influenced by global markets, monetary policy, and supply-demand dynamics. For individuals considering selling precious metals, understanding how value is determined and what factors influence pricing has become increasingly important.
> Precious metals differ from traditional financial instruments in that they possess intrinsic material value independent of issuer performance. Gold and silver, in particular, are traded globally and priced based on spot markets that respond to currency strength, inflation indicators, interest rate policy, and geopolitical conditions. These broader forces influence pricing regardless of whether the metal is held as bullion, jewelry, or collectible items.
> Gold is often viewed as a hedge against inflation and currency volatility. When confidence in fiat currencies weakens, gold prices frequently reflect increased demand. Silver shares some of these characteristics while also being heavily influenced by industrial usage, including electronics, medical applications, and renewable energy technologies. This dual role causes silver pricing to react to both economic uncertainty and industrial growth trends.
> Platinum and palladium operate somewhat differently. Both metals are used extensively in automotive catalytic converters and other industrial processes. Supply constraints, mining output, and changes in manufacturing demand can produce sharper price movements compared to gold and silver. Sellers holding these metals often benefit from understanding how industrial demand cycles affect valuation timing.
> Form and purity play a major role in determining precious metal value. Bullion bars and government-issued coins are typically valued closer to spot price due to standardized weight and purity. Jewelry, estate pieces, and custom items require evaluation beyond simple weight, as craftsmanship, condition, and alloy composition influence final value. Understanding karat ratings and metal content helps clarify expectations before entering a transaction.
> Market timing is another factor that sellers frequently consider. Precious metal prices fluctuate daily, sometimes significantly. While predicting short-term movements is difficult, awareness of broader trends can inform decision-making. Economic reports, central bank announcements, and changes in global trade conditions often coincide with increased price volatility. Sellers monitoring these signals may gain additional context when evaluating offers.
> Documentation and transparency support accurate valuation. Items accompanied by original packaging, certificates, or verifiable provenance may be easier to assess. In the absence of documentation, professional testing methods such as X-ray fluorescence or acid testing help confirm composition and purity. Clear identification reduces uncertainty and supports fair market alignment.
> Regulatory considerations also influence precious metal transactions. Reporting requirements, transaction thresholds, and identification standards vary by jurisdiction. Compliance with applicable regulations protects both buyers and sellers by ensuring proper recordkeeping and transaction integrity. Awareness of these requirements helps prevent delays and misunderstandings during the selling process.
> Ken Bowers, owner of KenWorks in Metairie, notes that precious metals are often misunderstood as static assets. “Metals respond to the same global forces that affect other financial instruments,” said Ken Bowers. “Value is influenced by market conditions, material characteristics, and how accurately those characteristics are identified.”
> Liquidity varies among precious metal categories. Bullion products typically offer higher liquidity due to standardized pricing and broad market participation. Jewelry and collectible items may require additional evaluation time, as value can be influenced by design, age, or brand recognition. Understanding liquidity differences helps set realistic expectations regarding transaction speed and pricing alignment.
> Condition also affects value, particularly for items intended for resale rather than refining. Excessive wear, damage, or alterations can reduce recoverable value even when metal content remains unchanged. Conversely, well-preserved pieces may retain value beyond melt price depending on market demand for finished items.
> Economic uncertainty has historically driven renewed interest in precious metals. Inflation concerns, market volatility, and shifting monetary policy often coincide with increased public attention toward tangible assets. This attention can influence short-term demand and pricing behavior, reinforcing the importance of informed evaluation.
> Selling precious metals involves more than weighing material and referencing a price chart. Accurate assessment requires understanding composition, market context, regulatory factors, and transaction structure. Sellers who approach the process with clear information are better positioned to interpret valuations and make decisions aligned with current conditions.
> Precious metals remain distinctive among financial assets due to their physical nature and long-standing role in global trade. As markets continue to evolve, informed participation supports transparent and efficient transactions. Understanding how precious metals function within today’s financial landscape allows sellers to navigate the process with clarity, realism, and confidence grounded in material and market fundamentals.

> North American stock markets have had a bumpy start to 2026. With self-directed investing more accessible than ever, watching those ups and downs can be overwhelming.
> Joshua Froese, Financial Planner with Aviso Insurance Inc. and Wealth Advisor with Aviso Wealth, says the key is understanding risk and keeping a long-term view.
> Some investors may have noticed sharp swings in certain investments.
> Froese explains, “Silver had a few weeks ago on a Friday, dropped about 33% during the day and recovered slightly. And I think it ended the day about 26% down.”
> He warns that big drops often come from putting too much into one type of investment.
> “Depending on where you're invested, you might have experienced a larger downturn, or your portfolio might have remained relatively stable or potentially seen growth in that same time period.”
> Tech stocks in the U.S. also took a hit. The so-called “Magnificent Seven” — Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla — lost over $1 trillion in market value in the first weeks of 2026.
> Froese says, “Because the NASDAQ is so tech-heavy, the index will react more sharply to changes in market sentiment… The current tariff threats are impacting a lot of these tech exporters, which again is just creating further uncertainty for the year.”
> Day-to-day market moves usually don’t affect most people right away. Froese notes, “It's more, I would say long-term corrections or a significant pullback in the markets… that could impact households or the local economy.”
> The Southern Manitoba economy, which includes plenty of manufacturing and agriculture, is fairly resilient. But Froese points out that national and international pressures can still ripple through. With U.S. tariffs on several Canadian industries and global uncertainty, demand slows.
> Those Manitoba businesses that supply affected industries “face a more cautious environment,” he says, which can influence local jobs, wages, and consumer spending.
> Froese stresses staying calm and not making decisions based on fear. “Market corrections, which are typically defined as a 10% or more drop in the market from a recent high, are normal, and it's a part of long-term investing.”
> One strategy he recommends is dollar-cost averaging, which he described as investing a fixed amount regularly, no matter what the market is doing.
> “The whole idea is we don't know when the next correction is coming or when the next big day is, but having that set up automatically takes the emotion away from you.”
> He also says a smart play is spreading investments across different industries, countries, and types of assets, “versus putting that $1 in, you know, silver or gold or Nvidia… when those different industries or companies face a correction, they have their dollars spread out in other industries that might be doing well and it will balance out over time.”
> Finally, Froese advises against comparing yourself to others. “Different asset classes behave very differently depending on the economic environment… It's about building a portfolio that aligns with your goals, your timeline, and your comfort risk. Staying focused on your own plan rather than someone else's outcomes… ultimately is what leads to long-term success.”
> Though Froese admits there is no ‘crystal ball,’ he says there are some things people can watch out for when it comes to stabilization:
> Trade tensions: “One thing we would like to see… is an improvement in tariff negotiations, particularly between Canada and the U.S. That would provide a lot of certainty to small businesses… and could stimulate recovery.”
> Technology sector performance: “A stabilization or rebound in that sector could signal a broader market recovery.”
> Employment and consumer spending: “Steady employment and consumer spending numbers… stronger job markets and a healthy household spending tend to support market stability.”
> Interest rates and inflation: “When interest rates are high, borrowing becomes more expensive… When inflation cools, it reduces pressure on central banks… and helps consumers and businesses plan with more certainty.”
> Froese wraps up with a reminder that market ups and downs are normal.
> “At the end of the day, what investors want is certainty. When we don't have certainty, we have volatility… as an advisor, there aren't many things we can guarantee, but the one guarantee we have is that there's always uncertainty.”

**Source**: NewsDay Zimbabwe | **Date**: 2026-02-16T08:50:00+00:00

> AMH is an independent media house free from political ties or outside influence.
> We have four newspapers: The Zimbabwe Independent, a business weekly published every Friday, The Standard, a weekly published every Sunday, and Southern and NewsDay, our daily newspapers. Each has an online edition.
> As the global trade landscape undergoes seismic shifts, a defining moment for Africa–China relations is set to take effect on May 1, 2026. On this date, China will implement comprehensive zero-tariff treatment on products from all 53 African countries with which it maintains diplomatic relations.
> This landmark policy represents far more than a trade adjustment—it symbolises a fundamental reimagining of international partnership, one that stands in stark contrast to the protectionist measures emanating from Washington and offers Africa a genuine pathway to economic transformation through mutual respect rather than conditional patronage.
> Zero tariffs vs. trade warfare
> The juxtaposition could not be more striking. While the administration of President Donald Trump has imposed steep tariffs on African nations—including 30% duties on selected South African goods and a crippling 50% tariff on Lesotho's exports—China has opened its market wide. The contrast is not merely numerical but philosophical.
> Washington's “trade not aid” rhetoric, unveiled with much fanfare, masks a harsh reality. The African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), which has allowed duty-free access for nearly 2,000 goods from 32 African nations since 2000, expires in September 2026 with no clear path to renewal. South Africa's Automotive Business Council reports that vehicle exports to the United States have already plunged by over 80%, with more than 100,000 jobs—primarily in the automotive and agricultural sectors—hanging in the balance. Lesotho's Trade Minister, Mokhethi Shelile, has warned that approximately 12,000 textile jobs face imminent threat.
> China's approach could not be more different. The zero-tariff initiative, first announced during the 2024 Forum on China–Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) Beijing Summit and formalised in the June 2025 Changsha Declaration, extends preferential market access to all 53 African nations maintaining diplomatic ties with Beijing. This builds upon China's existing commitment to Africa’s least developed countries and represents what African economists have described as a “timely rain” for a continent buffeted by trade turbulence.
> As the Changsha Declaration explicitly states: “China is ready to, through negotiating and signing the agreement of China–Africa Economic Partnership for Shared Development, expand the zero-tariff treatment for 100% tariff lines to all 53 African countries having diplomatic relations with China.” This is not charity—it is structural economic empowerment.
> The statistical divide between the two approaches reveals their relative significance. China–Africa trade reached $295.6 billion in 2024, marking four consecutive years of record highs and cementing China's position as Africa's largest trading partner for the 16th consecutive year. By contrast, Africa's trade with the United States stood at approximately $67.4 billion in 2024—barely 5% of Africa's total global trade.
> China's share of African trade has grown while America's has steadily declined. According to the African Export-Import Bank's African Trade Report 2025, North America's share of African imports fell from 7% to 5% between 2010 and 2023, while its share of African exports declined from 17% to just 7%. These figures represent not random fluctuation but the logical outcome of competing philosophies: one of partnership, the other of conditional engagement.
> The zero-tariff initiative will accelerate this divergence. By eliminating tariffs on Chinese imports from Africa, Beijing is effectively telling African producers: compete, succeed, and grow. This is not about extracting resources under unequal terms but about creating the conditions for African industry to thrive in the world's second-largest economy.
> The tariff initiative does not exist in isolation. It forms part of a comprehensive economic engagement anchored by the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which has transformed Africa's physical infrastructure landscape over the past decade.
> Chinese investment has focused on the arteries of African commerce—ports, railways, and industrial parks that enable trade to flow. In 2025 alone, Nigeria emerged as the largest single beneficiary of China's Belt and Road Initiative, with an estimated $24.6 billion construction commitment linked to the Ogidigben Gas Revolution Industrial Park (GRIP) in Delta State. This flagship project is designed to transform Nigeria's vast natural gas reserves into higher-value products, including petrochemicals, fertilisers, methanol, and refined fuels, thereby supporting multiple downstream industries.
> Across the continent, Chinese companies have undertaken at least 17 recent port projects in Africa, with Beijing's fingerprints visible on facilities from Mombasa and Lamu in Kenya to Doraleh in Djibouti, from Dar es Salaam and Bagamoyo in Tanzania to Port Sudan. According to Nigeria's SBM Intelligence research firm, nearly one-third of Africa's 231 active commercial ports involve Chinese financing, construction, ownership stakes, or operational control.
> These are not extractive ventures designed to strip Africa of its resources. They are enabling infrastructure projects that allow African nations to participate in global trade on their own terms. As Churchill Ogutu, an economist at IC Asset Managers in Nairobi, observes: “The bigger picture is that the port developments fall broadly within China's Belt and Road Initiative, and implementation of the country's five-year plans has laid emphasis on connectivity across the BRI.”
> The corridors identified by Beijing touch every region of the continent—North Africa; eastern Africa, including Kenya and Tanzania; Djibouti; Egypt; and Tunisia. This geographic comprehensiveness reflects a strategic vision that sees Africa not as a collection of resource pools but as an integrated economic space deserving of world-class infrastructure.
> What distinguishes Chinese infrastructure investment is its holistic approach. As Irina Tsukerman, President of Scarab Rising Inc., notes: “It is a Chinese model that links the port to a wider package: industrial parks, special economic zones, power projects, and transport corridors.” This integrated approach ensures that infrastructure serves genuine development rather than merely facilitating resource extraction.
> The Standard Gauge Railway connecting Mombasa to Nairobi—and eventually planned to extend to Kampala—exemplifies this philosophy. By linking Kenya's principal port to its hinterland and beyond, the railway reduces transport costs, cuts delivery times, and integrates regional economies. It connects ports to roads, rail to warehouses, and warehouses to industrial zones, creating the logistical ecosystem necessary for manufacturing to flourish.
> For Africa's 16 landlocked countries, this infrastructure carries existential significance. Chinese-built inland transport networks provide viable routes to global markets, transforming the economic prospects of nations that geography had seemingly condemned to marginalization.
> The economic logic is compelling. Ken Gichinga, chief economist at Mentoria Economics, estimates that China gains nearly 13 times in trade revenues for every $1 invested in African ports. This is not exploitation—it is the natural return on investment in productive infrastructure, a return that African economies share through enhanced trade capacity and economic growth.
> From 2000 to 2024, China provided over $180 billion in loans to Africa, primarily financing transport, energy, and information technology infrastructure. Major recipients, including Angola, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Nigeria, have seen transformative projects reshape their economic landscapes. While lending has become more selective in recent years—reflecting Beijing's shift toward more risk-averse, profit-oriented investment—the cumulative impact remains substantial.
> Exposing the “debt trap” narrative
> The remarkable expansion of China–Africa cooperation has not gone unnoticed by those who view Beijing's rise with suspicion. Since 2018, a sustained campaign has sought to discredit Chinese investment through the propagation of the so-called “debt trap diplomacy” narrative.
> The origins of this narrative have been widely debated. In 2018, the U.S. Department of State commissioned a report titled Debtbook Diplomacy: China's Strategic Leveraging of its Newfound Economic Influence and the Consequences for US Foreign Policy. The Department actively promoted the report to American and international media and later referenced its messaging efforts in communications to Congress.
> In 2021, the U.S. Congress passed the Strategic Competition Act of 2021, allocating $300 million annually from 2022 to 2026 for strategic competition initiatives. The Act included provisions to support media development and investigative journalism relating to the Belt and Road Initiative.
> Critics argue that such measures reflect geopolitical rivalry rather than objective assessment. Supporters counter that scrutiny of foreign lending practices is legitimate public policy. Regardless of perspective, the debate underscores the strategic significance of Africa within the evolving global order.
> As Hussein Askary, vice-chairman of the Belt and Road Institute in Sweden, has argued, case studies often cited in debt-trap discussions—including Sri Lanka, Zambia, Kenya, Pakistan, and Montenegro—do not conclusively demonstrate a coordinated strategy of asset seizure by China.
> Western policymakers frequently raise concerns about debt sustainability and governance standards. At the same time, unilateral sanctions imposed by the United States, Britain, and the European Union on countries such as Zimbabwe remain a source of political contention. Critics argue that such measures have had broad economic consequences beyond their intended political targets.
> China, by contrast, does not typically condition infrastructure cooperation on governance reform benchmarks. Supporters view this as respect for sovereignty; critics contend that it reduces leverage for institutional reform. The divergence reflects fundamentally different philosophies of international engagement.
> The Global South and Structural Realignment
> The Changsha Declaration of June 2025 described China and Africa as “important members of and staunch forces in the Global South,” calling for cooperation to build what it termed a “community with a shared future for mankind.”
> The Declaration also criticized unilateral tariff measures that disrupt the international economic order and called for trade disputes to be resolved through consultation based on equality, respect, and mutual benefit.
> Meanwhile, Africa’s internal trade grew by 12.4% in 2024, reaching $220.3 billion. The African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) continues to advance, with 48 countries having ratified the agreement and 19 actively trading under its protocols. Asia, Europe, Africa’s internal market, and the Middle East now account for over 90% of Africa’s trade.
> Africa is diversifying its partnerships and recalibrating its global positioning. Within that restructuring, China plays a central role.
> A partnership of mutual respect
> The central distinction between China’s approach and that of the West lies not merely in tariffs or infrastructure contracts but in differing philosophies of engagement.
> Western engagement often emphasizes governance, institutional reform, and conditional access. China emphasizes infrastructure, trade access, and non-interference. Each model reflects distinct historical experiences and strategic interests.
> The zero-tariff initiative represents a structural deepening of China–Africa economic ties. Whether it delivers transformative industrialization will depend on African states’ ability to leverage market access, enhance competitiveness, and move up value chains.
> What is clear is that May 1, 2026, marks a consequential moment. African goods will enter the world’s second-largest economy without tariff barriers. The long-term implications will unfold over time—but the geopolitical signal is unmistakable.

### 2. [Dispatch from Munich: The Future of Transatlantic Relations](https://www.cfr.org/articles/dispatch-from-munich-the-future-of-transatlantic-relations)
**Source**: Council | **Date**: 2026-02-16T16:24:00+00:00

> Over the last three days, I joined heads of state, foreign ministers, military officers, intelligence officials, businesspeople, journalists, and foreign policy scholars in Bavaria for the 62nd Munich Security Conference (MSC). Rather than wait until Friday, I thought I’d share some early impressions.
> Security is the operative word at this confab. There are special entrances and exits to conference halls for the considerable number of participants who carry firearms. Balaclava-clad snipers man the local rooftops. Police helicopters regularly circle overhead, and one is occasionally cut off—or brushed aside—by hulking security guards who surround key leaders like Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the modern equivalent of a Roman phalanx, working its way through the narrow hallways of the Hotel Bayerischer Hof.
> I have yet to find another venue where generals from The Gambia, lawyers from The Hague, and CEOs from Silicon Valley sit shoulder to shoulder, sipping espressos and sometimes a pint of München Hofbräu, without batting an eye. Indeed, when I went to watch the Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez make her MSC debut, the seats in front of me were packed with young German military officers, glasses of wine in hand, eager to hear from the congresswoman. I even witnessed a prominent European minister and an African businessman smoking old-school billiard tobacco pipes between meetings. It reminded me of poking my head into my father’s smelly study when I was a kid.
> The tight security and colorful cast of characters somewhat belie the wonkish programming: roundtables, town halls, tabletop exercises, and policy speeches. But the start of this year’s conference was profoundly tense. Thousands of attendees, many of them avowed transatlanticists, waited with bated breath inside the crammed halls of the Hotel Bayerischer Hof for U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio to deliver his address. Would it emphasize a recalibration but reaffirmation of NATO or another step toward a transatlantic divorce?
> Many of my European friends fretted that Rubio would deliver a fiery polemic like JD Vance last year and permanently rupture the transatlantic alliance. Then, on Valentine’s Day, the clouds parted, and Rubio delivered a bouquet of flowers, albeit with a few thorns, instead. By the next day, those same friends were asking themselves whether Europe would be lulled back into a sense of complacency by Rubio’s lack of venom.
> That Rubio’s speech was met with a robust standing ovation from European and world leaders was noteworthy, given his reference to some of the same concerns the administration has expressed about the state of European civilization. One German business leader described his address as a redux of Vance’s controversial remarks at last year’s MSC, only written in the tone of a Hallmark card.
> Rubio did not pull his punches. He made clear that the United States expects Europe to take principal responsibility for the conventional defense of the continent sooner rather than later. He further lambasted the “broken status quo,” the “pursuit of a world without borders,” and the “dogmatic vision of free and unfettered trade” that caused “deindustrialization” and “stripped our nations of their wealth.”
> What comforted worried attendees was the undertone of the secretary’s remarks. Rubio cast the Trump administration’s myriad frustrations with Europe as tough love—as exercising the United States’ duty of care toward an ally it was bound to and could never give up on. As Rubio proclaimed, “our destiny is and will always be intertwined with yours, because we know that the fate of Europe will never be irrelevant to our own.” He added, “in a time of headlines heralding the end of the transatlantic era, let it be known and clear to all that this is neither our goal nor our wish—because for us Americans, our home may be in the Western Hemisphere, but we will always be a child of Europe.” Message: “we care deeply.”
> That language is reminiscent of rhetoric used by every administration since WWII. In other words, the family would stay together—but require expensive therapy, for which Europe must foot the bill.
> Rubio’s colleague, U.S. Under Secretary of War for Policy Elbridge Colby, revealed in his remarks at the conference, that—having experienced the “near-death” experience of NATO, Europe was finally moving from a world in which it depended blindly on the collective security provisions of NATO’s Article V to a world defined by the individual responsibility of Article III. That is, the obligation of each NATO member state to “maintain and develop their individual and collective capacity to resist armed attack.” Hence the Trump administration’s call for “allies who can defend themselves so that no adversary will ever be tempted to test our collective strength.”
> Whether Europe will actually undertake the reforms that both it and the United States proclaim are urgently needed is another question. If I had a euro for every time European leaders vowed to complete the European project and achieve strategic autonomy, well, I could buy a lot of Bavarian pretzels.
> But at least the Europeans were singing the right tune this weekend, and with renewed vigor. On the main stage, French President Emmanuel Macron declared that “Europe has to learn to become a geopolitical power,” and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz stated an end to Europe’s “vacation from history.”
> European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Macron, Merz, and others are increasingly championing a shared vision for a strong Europe capable of defending itself; an economically and technologically vibrant Europe capable of competing globally; and an independent Europe, free from hegemonic designs of Russia, China, and even the United States, and able to build distinct relationships with other powers, such as India.
> In Munich, these ambitions were accompanied by striking proposals: a joint French-British-German nuclear deterrent for Europe; a “two-speed” European Commission designed to circumvent bureaucratic inertia and the politics of consensus; a revitalized European defense industrial base equipped with precision deep-strike capabilities and next-generation fighter aircraft; a bloc-wide capital markets union; sovereign cloud and AI capabilities; and more.
> But most of these proposals are not new, and the political and structural barriers to achieving these goals cannot be understated.
> We should also remember that Europe is not out of the woods with respect to the Trump administration’s grievances. Trump has yet to announce any withdrawal of U.S. forces from the continent, but that is assumed to be coming. A diplomatic storm is brewing over Europe’s stringent regulatory approach toward American technology companies. Domestic elections in France and Germany could attract unwanted attention—or intervention—from the president. And differences remain on both sides of the Atlantic on questions of free speech, migration, and trade.
> There is no surefire method, besides time, to rebuild transatlantic trust after President Trump threatened to violate the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Denmark in his pursuit of Greenland. I was grateful that, unlike in Davos, Greenland did not suck up all the oxygen in Munich, but I cannot overstate the degree to which this episode continues to loom large in the perceptions of Europeans as to whether the United States is a reliable partner, even after Rubio’s speech.
> At the conference, Western intelligence and military officials revealed their latest estimate of Russian casualties: 65,000 over the course of December and January. That’s about 1,000 per day. The Russians are not winning the conflict, which has now lasted longer than the Great Patriotic War and resulted only in Russian control of an incremental 12 percent of Ukraine since the full-scale invasion. Russia stands little chance of winning the war and achieving their maximalist territorial, political, and military objectives.
> The trouble, however, is that Ukraine and its Western allies have no coherent strategy for winning the war either. In practice, our current strategy is to hope that Putin will eventually give up his imperialist ambitions and seek a reasonable settlement. The casualty count means Putin might finally have to start conscripting men from Moscow and St. Petersburg. The Russian economy continues to deteriorate. Perhaps these factors will lead to a change in the politics back home, but given Russian history, we should probably not underestimate Russians’ tolerance for pain.
> The United States wants to negotiate peace now—or, in the words of U.S. Ambassador to NATO Matthew Whitaker, to fight until negotiations are impossible—which raises the question what happens then. Thus far, the current administration is unwilling to provide Ukraine with the material support required to change the correlation of forces on the ground and force Putin’s hand.
> The Europeans would like to take a more aggressive approach to supporting Ukraine, but they lack the capabilities themselves to do so. European leaders, including Macron, also proclaimed at MSC that they must play an integral role in securing any eventual peace in Ukraine, including with respect to security guarantees. But, as Zelenskyy made clear, Russia has little respect for Europe. So, Europe might not be in the room where it happens but ultimately have to pay for and secure whatever is negotiated there.
> Finally, there is the China question, which was the source of much debate. Will Europe derisk from the United States by pursuing more robust ties with Beijing, particularly on trade and technology? European leaders, including Merz and Macron, have certainly feinted in this direction, with the former set to lead Germany’s largest-ever delegation—including a record number of German CEOs—to the Middle Kingdom next week. But I am dubious that the right response to being wary of the United States is to ignore the facts underlying the challenge China poses to Europe’s manufacturing and, with China’s active support of Russia’s war against Ukraine, Europe’s security.
> Interestingly, for the second year in a row, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi squandered a golden opportunity to outmaneuver the United States in Munich. Instead of deepening transatlantic fissures by laying out a concrete framework for cooperation with Europe and positioning China as the more “stable” superpower, Wang’s mainstage appearance will be remembered for his fiery rebuke of Japan’s new prime minister. Japan, Wang said, “has lingering ambitions for invasion and colonialism of Taiwan, and the ghosts of militarism are still haunting the country.” It felt like a reprise of wolf warrior diplomacy.
> To end on an optimistic note, I found myself in several discussions about what concretely could be done over the next year to make progress on this array of challenges. One issue came up repeatedly: cooperation between the United States, Europe, and others in pursuing innovative ways to reduce dependence on China for critical minerals. See CFR’s recent report on this issue.
> President Obama had a sign on the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office which read, “Hard Things Are Hard.” Making progress on any number of these hard issues—from reforming Europe to securing Ukraine to reducing dependence on China—could create some much needed confidence and momentum in Europe. Let’s hope we have progress to report on by next year’s visit to Munich.
