### 2. [US Dollar Remains Firm Amid Weak Conviction](https://www.investing.com/analysis/us-dollar-remains-firm-amid-weak-conviction-200675227)
**Source**: Investing.com | **Date**: 2026-02-18T11:05:00+00:00

> The US dollar was sold to new session lows against several currency pairs late in the North American afternoon yesterday, but there has been little follow-through today. The greenback is firmer against most of the G10 currencies today in subdued activity. The highlight includes an unexpected dovish hold by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand and a soft UK CPI. Many financial centers in the Asia Pacific region are on extended holiday.
> With US-Iran and Russia-Ukraine negotiations, the geopolitical tensions are elevated. Japan has agreed to the first installment of the $550 investment program agreed to avoid higher US tariffs, but it still is not clear how much new money versus loans and loan guarantees are involved. The market impact seems minimal, but it probably sets the stage for a friendly meeting next month between President Trump and Prime Minister Takaichi. While the US economic calendar is full today, the week’s highlights, including the first estimate of Q4 GDP and a possible Supreme Court ruling on the president’s tariff powers still lie ahead.
> • The euro was sold to a seven-day low yesterday, slightly above $1.1800. It recovered to record a new session high in the NY afternoon, near $1.1855, leaving a potential bullish hammer candlestick in its wake. However, there was practically no follow-through buying today. Tentative support has been found near $1.1830, but a retest of yesterday’s lows cannot be ruled out. The five-day moving average is slipping through the 20-day moving average for the first time in nearly a month.
> • The dollar reached a four-day high against the yen yesterday, slightly shy of JPY154.00. It backed off to nearly JPY153 today but has rebounded to approach JPY154.00. A move above the JPY154.35 area will improve the dollar’s technical tone. It could signal an advance toward JPY155, a technical retracement target and around the 20-day moving average. The US and Japan have reached an agreement on $36 bln investment in US oil, gas, and critical materials as part of the $550 bln commitment made under threat of higher tariffs. The trade minister has indicated that only 1-2% will be cash, loans and loan guarantees will be the main funding mechanism.
> • The disappointing UK employment data has been followed by soft inflation data. The chances of a rate cut next month have been boosted to a little over 80% from about 70% a week ago, according to the swaps market. Yesterday, sterling fell below $1.35 for the first time since January 23. It recovered back to almost $1.3560 after London closed, but technical damage was done. The five-day moving average crossed below the 20-day moving average on Monday for the first time in almost a month. It is trading quietly today in about a third of a cent above $1.3350. A convincing break of $1.3500 could target the $1.3440-60 area.
> • The US dollar extended its recovery against the Canadian dollar yesterday. The greenback bottomed last Wednesday around CAD1.35 with a powerful outside up day. It reached almost CAD1.37 yesterday and then was sold back to the session low near CAD1.3635 in the North American afternoon. A bearish shooting star pattern looks to have been formed, but follow-through selling was minimal today and the US dollar has recovered into the CAD1.3665 area. The month’s high was near CAD1.3725 (Feb 6). A band of support is seen in the CAD1.3575-CAD1.3600 area. There are $1.4 bln of options at CAD1.36 that expire today and another stack for almost $680 mln that expires there tomorrow.
> • The Australian dollar was pressed to a six-day low yesterday and slipped slightly through $0.7030 before rebounding to new session highs near $0.7090. That area has held today, and the Aussie has been pulled lower by the US dollar’s broadly firmer tone and the unexpected dovish hold by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, which sent the New Zealand dollar to a new eight-day low near $0.5990. Options for nearly A$500 mln at $0.7000 expire tomorrow.
> • The dollar looked as if it might break higher against the Mexican peso yesterday, but sellers reemerged a little above Monday’s high (~MXN17.1910) and drove it a little below MXN17.11. It posted the lowest close of the month yesterday (~MXN17.1285). After posting the outside down day yesterday, the greenback has been sold to a new low today since June 2024, near MXN17.0865.
> • After falling to CNH6.8810 on Monday, the dollar held above it yesterday but stalled a little above CNH6.8920. Today, the dollar has not moved off the CNH6.88-handle. The five-day moving average is around CNH6.8960. The greenback has not settled above it this month.
> • The Indian rupee traded quietly in a narrow range as the consolidative phase continues. The dollar was confined to an INR90.5965-INR90.7150 range. It continues to trade within the range set on February 6. The central bank is proposing tighter rules of disclosure of foreign exchange transactions by banks.
> • Many equity markets in the Asia Pacific region are closed for the extended holiday. Those that were open tended to advance, including Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and India. Europe’s Stoxx 600 is up nearly 1% in late European morning turnover and is extending its advance for the third consecutive session. US index futures are extending yesterday’s recovery and are up around 0.50%.
> • Benchmark 10-year yields are mixed. Japan’s 10-year yield edged up. European rates are mostly +/-  around half of a basis point, while the soft inflation report is underpinning Gilts, where the 10-year yield is off one basis point. The 10-year Treasury yield that approached 4% early this week is slightly firmer, a little above 4.06%.
> • Gold is firmer. It held above yesterday’s low (~~$4843.50) and reached slightly above $4942 today. Similarly, silver held above yesterday’s low near $72 and recovered above $76 today.
> • March WTI is trading higher today. It briefly traded below $62 yesterday but is trading nearly $1 higher in the European morning and is near $63.35. Yesterday’s high was a little above $64. Geopolitical tensions continue to run high.
> • Today sees a flurry of US economic data. December’s durable goods orders and housing starts may help economists fine tune Q4 GDP expectations, which will be reported Friday. January industrial output will be reported. January manufacturing jobs and aggregate hours rose, suggesting manufacturing output rose and the cold spell likely boosted the output of utilities. The FOMC minutes from the late January meeting will be published, but outside of Governors Miran and Waller, there seems to a consensus in favor of a pause after three rates cuts in the last few months of last year. Lastly, late in the session, the December TIC data will be reported. Contrary to the popular “sell America” meme, through November, foreigners had done the exact opposite. Settling through US custodians, foreign investors bought $1.32 trillion of US stocks and bonds compared with $1.12 trillion in the first 11 months of 2024. That said, foreign investors were net sellers of US financial assets in the first month of each quarter last year.
> • Canada reports January existing home sales. They fell in seven months in 2025 and ended the year with a 2.7% decline in December.
> • The UK’s January CPI fell by 0.5% and the year-over-year rate eased to 3.0% from 3.4%. The core rate ticked down to 3.1% from 3.2%. Service inflation softened slightly to 4.4% from 4.5%.
> • The Reserve Bank of New Zealand held policy steady at 2.25%, but the bias seemed dovish not hawkish as the market expected. And the central bank noted that policy is likely to remain accommodative. The RBNZ expects inflation to fall back to the midpoint of its 1-3% target. It sees the possibility of a hike in Q4.
> • Japan’s January’s trade balance always deteriorates in January (25 years without fail), and this year was no exception. The December trade surplus of JPY113.5 bln swung to a JPY1.152 bln deficit in January, despite the 16.8% year-over-year jump in exports and a 2.5% decline in imports. In January 2025, Japan’s trade deficit was JPY2.74 trillion. Last year, exports to the US fell (~4.1%), led by autos and chip-fabrication machinery, but it still recorded a trade surplus (JPY7.52 trillion or ~$47.5 bln), about 1/8 smaller than in 2024. Shipments to China were off 0.4%, and Japan reported a JPY7.91 bln deficit with China in 2024.
> • Australia’s wage price index was steady at 3.4% year-over-year in Q4 25. This reflected a 0.8% increase on the quarter, the same as in Q3. This measure is similar to US unit labor costs, taking into account labor costs and productivity. Tomorrow, the January employment figures are due, and the median forecast in Bloomberg’s survey is for the net creation of 20k jobs (65.2k in December). The unemployment rate is expected to rise to 4.2% from 4.1%.

### 3. [Quadro: An illusion or a reality in a fractured world order?](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/quadro-an-illusion-or-a-reality-in-a-fractured-world-order-ws-e-13981082.html)
**Source**: Firstpost | **Date**: 2026-02-18T08:19:00+00:00

> It may be argued that the end of the Cold War, America’s triumphalism, the trauma of 9/11, the acceleration of globalisation, and the consolidation of a liberal international order together laid the foundations of what the 21st century now confronts as a ‘polycrisis’. We are witnessing the simultaneous unfolding of multiple, interconnected, and mutually reinforcing crises — financial instability, climate stress, technological disruption, supply-chain vulnerabilities, and the Covid-19 pandemic. Yet it would not be incorrect to suggest that the defining rupture of this polycrisis has been the 2022 war in Ukraine, whose cascading consequences continue to reshape global politics.
> The ongoing conflict, combined with US President Donald J. Trump’s second term in office, has intensified this turbulence. In many ways, the signals were visible during his first term; the second has merely amplified them. What we are witnessing is not simply policy divergence but a deeper geopolitical rupture.
> The war in Ukraine and Trump’s renewed presidency have accelerated an already unfolding global churn, compelling states to navigate a profoundly unsettled environment marked by widening divisions. On one side stands a fragmented West, grappling with internal fissures — particularly between the United States and Europe. On the other, a more assertive Global South is emerging, no longer willing to passively accept rules crafted elsewhere but increasingly determined to shape the frameworks that govern international order.
> The roles played by India and China during the Ukraine conflict, and their continued assertiveness in global and regional arenas, underscore this shift. Despite sustained pressure, the US-led West has found it increasingly difficult to impose its preferred outcomes on major developing powers. This signals not merely policy disagreement but a dilution of Western dominance.
> The 21st century thus appears to be experiencing a systemic inflection point, driven in considerable measure by the actions of the United States, the erstwhile hegemon. Trump’s withdrawal from key post-war multilateral commitments, his remarks regarding Greenland, US military actions targeting Iran, threats to recalibrate commitments to NATO, and the proposal of a so-called ‘Board of Peace’ together suggest a deeper unease within global governance structures. These moves reflect not confidence but strategic anxiety — symptoms of a hegemon grappling with relative decline and recalibrating its global role.
> The ripple effects of these developments are visible across multiple domains. The expiration of the New START treaty between the United States and Russia has revived anxieties about strategic arms competition. China’s reluctance to enter a new arms control framework proposed by Washington further complicates strategic stability. Efforts at peace negotiations involving Russia, Ukraine and the United States — including those reportedly explored in the UAE — have thus far yielded limited progress. Meanwhile, the weaponisation of sanctions, escalating tariff disputes, renewed US–Iran tensions, a defence pact between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, and the lifting of sanctions on Bosnian Serb separatist leader Milorad Dodik collectively point towards an increasingly fragmented order.
> Taken together, these episodes illustrate a world in transition. The post-war architecture of collective security appears strained, and the durability of multilateral institutions is under question. The compass of global governance seems unsteady.
> This clash of worldviews was vividly displayed at the January 2026 Davos Summit, where speeches by Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney exposed the depth of transatlantic discord. Carney’s remarks reflected a growing erosion of trust in US leadership and urged smaller and middle powers to collaborate in shaping a rebalanced world order — one that harmonises values with political realism and shared responsibility.
> In contrast, Trump’s address — steeped in ‘Make America Great Again’ rhetoric — was met with scepticism by allies and observers alike. His reiteration of intentions to assume control over Greenland in the name of US security, alongside criticisms of NATO as a disproportionate financial burden, underscored tensions within the alliance. Absent from his remarks was any acknowledgement that NATO had invoked Article 5 for the first and only time in response to the 9/11 attacks, standing in solidarity with the United States.
> Closer to India’s neighbourhood, the regional landscape offers little comfort. Political transitions in Bangladesh and Myanmar, persistent instability in South Asia, diminishing US engagement in parts of the Indo-Pacific, deepening coordination among Russia, China and North Korea, and the growing prominence of groupings such as the SCO and BRICS+ all signal a shifting balance of power. These trends suggest not consolidation but diffusion — an order moving towards fragmentation rather than cohesion.
> Against this backdrop emerges the idea of Quadro — a quadrilateral partnership comprising India, Russia, the United States and China. At once ambitious and seemingly utopian, Quadro seeks to imagine structured engagement among the four most consequential poles of contemporary geopolitics.
> If such a framework were to materialise, it would likely resemble a concert-style stabilisation mechanism — akin to the Concert of Europe — or draw lessons from Cold War arms control arrangements and even the contemporary G20 format. Its success would depend on functional cooperation rather than ideological alignment. A civilisational or values-based framework would risk immediate collapse; a pragmatic, issue-based architecture might stand a greater chance.
> The international system is tentatively exploring forms of power-sharing within a multipolar setting, though hegemonic impulses continue to impede genuine accommodation. Major powers — including these four — have experimented with issue-based cooperation in areas such as climate change, artificial intelligence and financial stability. There is an emerging recognition that no single power can dominate every domain indefinitely.
> During the Covid-19 pandemic, China sought to leverage its centrality in global supply chains. More recently, it has attempted to consolidate influence over critical minerals. Yet countervailing coalitions have formed in response, demonstrating that concentrations of power generate balancing mechanisms. In this sense, Quadro reflects a structural reality: global public goods cannot be supplied by any single actor.
> Stability in such a system would require recognition — not denial — of power asymmetries. It would necessitate mutual acknowledgement of core interests, sustained channels of crisis communication, and selective cooperation even amid rivalry. Instances of India and China coordinating on global climate issues demonstrate that pragmatic engagement remains possible despite strategic distrust.
> What might emerge from this is a form of ‘polytunity’ — a purposeful realism that blends pluralism with unity. Polytunity does not eliminate rivalry; it manages it through structured engagement among indispensable actors.
> Yet formidable challenges persist. All four states prioritise national interest and maintain distinct conceptions of spheres of influence. Where such spheres intersect, ‘shatter zones’ emerge — regions vulnerable to proxy competition and instability.
> History offers cautionary lessons. Even during the Second World War, while the United States and the United Kingdom cooperated against Nazi Germany after the Soviet Union was attacked, competition for influence persisted between Roosevelt and Churchill. Alliances do not erase rivalry; they merely reconfigure it.
> In the contemporary context, a telling indicator would be China’s stance on India’s long-standing aspiration for permanent membership of the UN Security Council. Were Beijing to support India’s candidature without linking it to Pakistan’s inclusion, it would signal strategic accommodation of the highest order. Such a gesture would serve as a litmus test for the viability of Quadro.
> India occupies a distinctive position in this evolving order. Historically a leading voice of the developing world, it has consistently advocated inclusive platforms. Its presidency of the G20, which facilitated the African Union’s entry as a permanent member, reflects this approach.
> Simultaneously, India remains committed to preserving its strategic autonomy. It carefully balances relations with the United States, Russia, China, Japan, the European Union and others, resisting rigid bloc politics. While advocating reform of the UN Security Council, it also participates in diverse minilateral groupings such as the SCO, RIC and BRICS.
> India’s own experience — particularly its exclusion from permanent UNSC membership despite broad international support — may temper enthusiasm for elite frameworks that risk marginalising others. Its reluctance to join initiatives such as the proposed Board of Peace further illustrates this caution.
> Rather than being confined within a rigid quadrilateral, New Delhi appears more inclined towards a reformed multipolarity—towards polytunity rather than bloc consolidation.
> Quadro, as a conceptual proposition, carries undeniable appeal. The United States, China, Russia and India are unequal in power yet indispensable in different domains — military reach, economic scale, technological innovation, demographic weight and normative influence. Their structured engagement could potentially stabilise an unsettled order.
> However, the profound mistrust and strategic competition among them pose significant obstacles. Moreover, other influential actors — Japan, Brazil, the European Union, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Iran and others — are equally consequential. Excluding them risks fostering new bloc formations and further fragmentation.
> A wise observation suggests that ‘There will be peace when it is profitable’. If cooperative equilibrium proves beneficial to all four — and does not marginalise others — Quadro may transcend utopia. If not, selective exclusion and competitive spheres of influence may return the world to the very crises it now seeks to resolve.
> In an era of geopolitical rupture, Quadro remains suspended between possibility and illusion — its future contingent not on rhetoric but on the hard calculus of shared interest, restraint and pragmatic statecraft.
> (Dr Indrani Talukdar is a Fellow at the Chintan Research Foundation, New Delhi. Views expressed in the above piece are personal and solely those of the author. They do not necessarily reflect Firstpost’s views.)
> At the Munich Security Conference, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio signalled not a rupture but a recalibration of the transatlantic alliance. While reaffirming shared heritage and history, he made clear that the post-Cold War rules-based order has given way to a harder, interest-driven framework. The United States now views alliance through the lens of sovereignty, borders and national interest rather than liberal universalism. Institutions will endure only if they deliver outcomes aligned with American priorities. Europe faces a choice: align more closely with Washington’s strategic agenda or pursue greater autonomy. Munich marked the transformation of the alliance into a more conditional compact.

### 4. [America goes back to the shipyards as Trump aims to counter China in 'Maritime Golden Age'](https://www.firstpost.com/world/america-goes-back-to-the-shipyards-as-trump-aims-to-counter-china-in-maritime-golden-age-ws-e-13981185.html)
**Source**: Firstpost | **Date**: 2026-02-18T12:23:00+00:00

> The United States is preparing to return to its shipyards in a renewed industrial push that the administration has branded a “Maritime Golden Age”. The initiative, unveiled by Donald Trump, seeks to rebuild the country’s commercial shipbuilding capacity at a time when China dominates global production and Washington worries about strategic vulnerabilities.
> At the core of the new Maritime Action Plan is the creation of so-called “Maritime Prosperity Zones”, designated waterfront industrial corridors designed to attract shipbuilders, manufacturers and maritime suppliers through regulatory relief and financial incentives. Regions such as the Great Lakes are being eyed as potential hubs for revival, echoing the industrial policies of earlier American manufacturing booms.
> The plan aims to expand the number of US-built and US-flagged commercial vessels, reversing decades of decline that have left the country marginal in global ship construction. According to data cited by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), China now accounts for more than half of global shipbuilding output, while the US share is effectively negligible.
> The disparity underscores how far America’s maritime industrial base has withered since its mid-20th century peak. Once home to robust shipyards serving both commercial and military markets, the US industry has struggled with high labour costs, limited production scale and inconsistent federal investment.
> While pitched as an economic revitalisation effort, the strategy is deeply rooted in national security concerns. The administration argues that a weakened commercial fleet leaves the Pentagon dependent on foreign-built or foreign-crewed vessels to move troops and supplies during crises.
> A stronger US Merchant Marine, officials say, would ensure that military logistics are not exposed to geopolitical pressure in the event of conflict, particularly amid rising tensions with China. The effort complements Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth’s “Arsenal of Freedom” campaign and the Navy’s “Golden Fleet” objective, both of which aim to restore maritime industrial strength after years of shrinking budgets and contracting shipyard capacity.
> China’s shipyards benefit from substantial state support, integrated supply chains and economies of scale that allow rapid construction of both civilian and naval vessels. Analysts have warned that this production advantage gives Beijing leverage not only in trade but also in potential wartime mobilisation.
> By contrast, the United States builds only a handful of large commercial vessels each year. Reviving the sector would require sustained investment, workforce training and policy continuity that stretches beyond political cycles.
> The Maritime Action Plan also aligns with legislative proposals such as the SHIPS for America Act, which seeks to create incentives and legal authorities to strengthen domestic shipbuilding, commercial shipping and the broader industrial supply chain supporting US maritime power.
> Lawmakers backing the measure argue that industrial resilience has become as critical as technological superiority. In recent years, Washington has already moved to boost semiconductor and clean energy manufacturing domestically; the maritime sector is now emerging as another front in strategic competition.
> However, questions remain about whether regulatory incentives and prosperity zones alone can overcome structural disadvantages. US shipyards face higher construction costs than their Asian counterparts, and building commercial vessels domestically often proves far more expensive for operators than sourcing ships abroad.
> Supporters counter that the economic calculus must account for national security. By investing in shipbuilding, they argue, the US not only creates waterfront jobs and revitalises industrial communities but also reduces long-term strategic risk.
> For now, the administration’s “Maritime Golden Age” framing signals a broader shift in American economic policy away from pure market efficiency and toward industrial self-sufficiency in sectors deemed vital to security.
> If successful, the effort would mark a dramatic turning point for a country that once ruled the seas in industrial output as well as naval power. The question is whether America’s return to the shipyards can realistically narrow the gap with China or whether Beijing’s dominance has already set the global course.
> A think tank analysis shows 38% of Russia’s military personnel spending goes to families of dead soldiers, highlighting high casualties and economic strain. Rising costs and slow growth may push Russia to seek a ceasefire to ease its budget crisis.

## 📌 Topic: Federal Reserve Policy (Interest Rate Hikes vs. Cuts)
*(Found 5 articles)*

### 1. [Federal Reserve officials discussed interest rate hike scenarios at their last meeting](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/fed-interest-rate-hike-scenarios-rcna259604)
**Source**: NBC News | **Date**: 2026-02-18T22:15:00+00:00

> At their most recent meeting, Federal Reserve officials discussed scenarios in which an interest rate hike might be appropriate,  according to minutes of it released Wednesday.
> "Several" Fed officials thought there was a "possibility that upward adjustments" to interest rates "could be appropriate" if inflation continues to track above 2%, as it has for nearly five years.
> The deliberations underscore how inflation remains a pressing concern for the central bank, even as public attention remains primarily on the labor market.
> The minutes also suggest that the Fed's internal conversations remain largely insulated from President Donald Trump's monthslong pressure campaign to get the central bank to lower borrowing costs.
> Trump's multipronged attacks on the central bank and its chair,  Jerome Powell, culminated late last year in subpoenas served to the Fed related to its headquarters renovation.
> Nonetheless, there are few signs of the Fed moving rates in either direction anytime soon.
> Fed policymakers voted to keep interest rates unchanged at their late January meeting, after cutting rates three times at the end of 2025.
> The Fed is not expected to cut interest rates again until late summer, if it does at all this year.
> The meeting minutes say that at the Jan. 27 and Jan. 28 meeting in Washington, most officials thought the risk of the labor market weakening further "had moderated in recent months while the risk of more persistent inflation remained, and some commented that those risks had come into better balance."
> The balance they are speaking of is the balance of maintaining a strong labor market while keeping a lid on inflation, preferably as close to the central bank's 2% target as possible.
> The Fed has been trying to steady that balance since the Covid-19 pandemic began in 2020, and while inflation has come down significantly since then, it has been on a bumpy ride over the last year.
> In April 2025, overall inflation fell to 2.3%, before rising as high as 3% in September.
> On Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that overall inflation had fallen to 2.4% in January from 2.7% the month before.
> At the same time, BLS reported that job growth in 2025 had been revised down sharply from 584,000 jobs to just 181,000. The news followed significant downward revisions for the year before.
> BLS also reported last week that the economy added 130,000 jobs in January, more than expected, which economists viewed as the potential stabilization of recent weak hiring trends.
> The unemployment rate ticked down only slightly to 4.3% from 4.4% in December.
> With inflation showing no sign of hitting 2% just yet, members of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, who are already splintered down political lines, could grow more divided.
> But, they said, “further downward adjustments” to interest rates “would likely be appropriate if inflation were to decline in line with their expectations.”
> “Some participants commented that it would likely be appropriate to hold the policy rate steady for some time as the Committee carefully assesses incoming data.”
> In January, Trump said he planned to nominate Kevin Warsh to be the Fed's next chair after Powell's term ends in May.
> Warsh has spoken favorably over the last year of lower interest rates, a position that is already generally supported by Trump's three nominees already serving on the central bank's boards.
> Steve Kopack is a senior reporter at NBC News covering business and the economy.

### 2. [Federal Reserve's Balancing Act: Interest Rates and Inflation Dilemma](https://www.devdiscourse.com/article/science-environment/3809921-federal-reserves-balancing-act-interest-rates-and-inflation-dilemma)
**Source**: Devdiscourse | **Date**: 2026-02-18T19:48:00+00:00

> Federal Reserve policymakers agreed almost unanimously to maintain interest rates as they stand, demonstrating a collective caution amid economic uncertainty. However, discord remains concerning future moves—whether to nudge rates upwards should inflation persist above the 2% target or to hold steady or even decrease them if inflation lowers.
> Former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, President Trump's nominee to succeed Jerome Powell, faces the task of uniting divergent opinions within the Fed. This uncertainty emerges as policymakers evaluated last year's 75 basis points cuts and gauged the current economic climate with just a few dissenters favoring immediate rate reduction.
> Fed Governors voiced apprehensions about employment stability, contrasting with other officials who acknowledged inflation running a point above target and suggested possible rate hikes. Investors seem convinced that the Fed will hold its stance until June, welcoming Warsh with potential rate cuts at that time.

**Source**: Devdiscourse | **Date**: 2026-02-18T21:55:00+00:00

> In a near-unanimous decision, Federal Reserve policymakers opted to maintain current interest rates, with underlying divisions over the future course of action. The minutes from last month's meeting highlight debates around the potential for rate hikes or cuts, contingent on inflation trends and economic growth forecasts.
> Central to the discussion was the impact of artificial intelligence technology, with members divided between optimistic projections of increased productivity and concerns over rising asset values posing financial risks. Despite the AI-induced uncertainties, the committee chose to pause, reflecting on last year's rate cuts and economic adjustments.
> As Fed leadership transitions with Kevin Warsh set to possibly replace Jerome Powell, the central bank faces the challenge of navigating AI's economic restructuring while balancing inflation control and job market stability. This juxtaposition presents a complex landscape for the incoming chair to build consensus and steer future policy decisions.

> Investing.com -- The minutes of the Federal Reserve’s January monetary policy meeting on Wednesday showed that almost all participants supported the decision to hold interest rates steady.
> However, they also hinted that several participants were ready to consider rate hikes in the future if inflation remained above the central bank’s target of 2%.
> The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) in late January kept its key policy rate unchanged after three successive 25 basis point cuts, citing an improving economic growth outlook and labor market. The committee deemed that after a total of 75 basis points of easing, the current stance at 3.50%-3.75% was appropriate.
> Economic data since the Fed’s January meeting has included a blowout nonfarm payrolls report and a consumer inflation report that showed a moderation in prices, giving the Fed more room to hold rates steady and assess further indicators.
> "In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants noted that inflation had remained somewhat elevated and that available indicators suggested that economic activity had been expanding at a solid pace. They observed that job gains had remained low and that the unemployment rate had shown some signs of stabilization," the FOMC said in a statement.
> "Against this backdrop, almost all participants supported maintaining the current target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting, while a couple of participants preferred to lower the target range," the committee added.
> According to the CME FedWatch tool, market participants see the Fed restarting monetary policy easing with a 25 basis point cut in June.
> In their discussions about the outlook for monetary policy, several FOMC participants said that they would have "supported a two-sided description of the Committee’sfuture interest rate decisions."
> This description reflects the "possibility that upward adjustments to the target range forthe federal funds rate could be appropriate if inflation remains at above-target levels," the committee elaborated.
> The latest consumer price index report for January last week showed a moderation in headline prices on a M/M basis. The Fed, however, considers the personal consumption expenditures price index as its preferred inflation gauge. The latest reading for that is due on Friday.
> "Some participants commented that it would likely be appropriate to hold the policy rate steady for some time as the Committee carefully assesses incoming data," the FOMC said.
> The committee noted that a "number of these participants" felt that further rate cuts may in fact not be needed at all until there were clear signs that "the progress of disinflation was firmly back on track."
> The minutes come at a time when there has been uncertainty around the future actions of the central bank, especially after President Donald Trump’s nomination of former Governor Kevin Warsh as the next chair. Meanwhile, the threat to the Fed’s independence is also at the back of traders’ minds amid an ongoing investigation into current chair Jerome Powell.
> "Marginal hawkish skew vs. (market) expectations as ’several’ wanted two-sided risk statement but that seems a marginal argument at this point. Warsh’s biggest task is going to be mollifying those ’several,’ whomever they are," Guy LeBas, chief fixed income strategist at Janney, said on X (formerly Twitter).
> "Overall not much in the minutes, but arguably a slightly hawkish skew relative to market expectations," LeBas added.
> Wall Street had pared some of its gains after the release of the minutes. Here are some popular exchange-traded funds that track the benchmark S&P 500 index: SPDR® S&P 500® ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:VOO), and iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:IVV).

### 5. [Fed Minutes Show Division as Rate Cuts Remain on the Table](https://www.investopedia.com/fed-minutes-show-division-as-rate-cuts-remain-on-the-table-11909190)

> The Federal Reserve is still leaning toward cutting interest rates again this year, but the readout of its latest meeting shows all the reasons why it may not.
> The minutes of January’s meeting, released on Wednesday, displayed the clear division at the Fed over where it should go next after cutting rates three times in 2025.
> Most still think “further downward adjustments” are likely still necessary if inflation keeps decelerating, the minutes show. That’s in line with markets’ current expectations of a couple of rate cuts later this year.
> But with inflation still a bit above the Fed’s 2% target, some central bank officials appeared more reluctant. They argued that cutting rates more than necessary may push up prices again, undercutting their efforts to quell the inflation that spiked in 2022.
> “Several participants cautioned that easing policy further in the context of elevated inflation readings could be misinterpreted as implying diminished policymaker commitment to the 2% inflation objective, perhaps making higher inflation more entrenched,” the FOMC minutes said.
> The Fed’s next move will shape borrowing costs for mortgages, credit cards, and business loans. For investors and consumers, the debate underscores how inflation and jobs data could shift rate expectations this year.
> Indeed, several of them even thought the Fed’s communications should remove the current bias toward cutting rates again, the minutes show.
> While the Fed kept rates steady at 3.5% to 3.75% in January, its statement said officials would consider the “extent and timing of additional adjustments” —a signal that rate cuts were more likely than not. The minutes released Wednesday showed several “would have supported a two-sided description,” reflecting that rate hikes are just as possible if inflation remains above 2%.
> Few analysts see the Fed hiking rates this year, but the minutes nonetheless underline Fed officials’ focus on fully bringing inflation back to 2%. The most recent reading, from December, showed annual inflation was still slightly above 2.5%.
> “We must remain focused on our headline inflation objective; otherwise, I believe there is a real risk that inflation will get stuck closer to 3% than 2% in the long run,” Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid said last week.
> The Fed’s rate cuts last year were aimed at supporting a job market that was showing signs of weakening.
> But most Fed officials agreed those risks had “moderated in recent months while the risk of more persistent inflation remained,” the minutes said. That assessment came before January’s stronger-than-expected jobs report, which showed U.S. employers added 130,000 jobs and the unemployment rate fell to 4.3%.
> A few Fed officials appeared more worried about the job market backtracking—and appeared more confident inflation would keep climbing back down. They cautioned that keeping rates too high could make job losses more likely.
> “These participants cautioned that keeping policy overly restrictive could risk further deterioration in the labor market,” the minutes said.
> Fed Governors Stephen Miran and Christopher Waller both voted against January’s decision to keep rates unchanged. In his dissent statement, Waller said job gains in 2025 were “very weak” and that conditions don’t “remotely look like a healthy labor market.”
> With inflation “just slightly above 2% and a weak labor market,” the Fed has room to cut rates a bit further, he argued.
> “Employers are reluctant to fire workers, but also very reluctant to hire,” Waller said.
> Some analysts agree with that assessment.
> “We expect employment growth to drop back to its weak earlier pace over the next few months, putting renewed upward pressure on the unemployment rate,” Oliver Allen, senior U.S. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote on Wednesday.
> Inflation “remains the main barrier to additional cuts,” Allen wrote, but those worries should ease in the months ahead as tariff-driven price bumps fade. He sees the Fed cutting rates three times again this year, in June, July and September—all of which would presumably occur under the new Fed chair’s tenure.
> The Fed is “firmly on hold…for now,” he wrote.
> Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. “Monetary Policy and the Economic Outlook.”

> UK inflation fell sharply to 3% in January, strengthening expectations that the Bank of England could cut interest rates as early as March and offering some relief to households after months of stubborn price pressures.
> Headline CPI dropped from 3.4% in December, while core inflation eased to 3.1% and services inflation edged down to 4.4%.
> The monthly fall of 0.5% leaves inflation at its lowest level since March last year.
> “A reading of 3% this morning is good news, not least as it shows December’s uptick in inflation has not carried forward into the new year and progress back towards 2% is regaining momentum,” said Emma Hollingworth, chief distribution officer of LSL Financial Services.
> Motorists benefited from petrol prices falling to their lowest level since summer 2021, while food inflation eased after Christmas, though analysts warned grocery costs remain elevated and continue to shape household budgets.
> Reaction as Bank of England cuts interest rates to 3.75%
> Luke Bartholomew, deputy chief economist at Abderdeen, said: “The drop in inflation back to 3% should clear the way for the Bank of England to cut interest rates in March.
> “Granted services inflation was a tad stronger than expected, and this does play an important role in the Bank’s thinking.
> “But with the labour market data yesterday pointing to ongoing weakness in employment and a further softening in pay growth, most policymakers are likely to look through any short-run stickiness in the services data.
> George Lagarias, chief economist at forvis mazars, argued that the broader economic backdrop now supports faster easing.
> “Gravity is finally settling in. An economy of sluggish growth, climbing unemployment and softer wage growth, in the eye of a global trade disruption, has absolutely zero reason to be consistently inflationary,” he said.
> “We would expect to see faster rate cuts going forward from this point on.”
> Kevin Brown, savings expert at Scottish Friendly, warned that easing inflation does not mean households are out of the woods.
> “Even at 3%, prices are still rising meaningfully year on year,” he said, noting the continued impact on the real value of savings.
> For borrowers, a rate cut could ease mortgage costs and boost housing market activity, while for savers the outlook is more complex as falling inflation is likely to be accompanied by lower returns on cash.
> Many experts now broadly expect gradual rate cuts through 2026 rather than a rapid easing cycle.
> Charlie Ambler, co-chief investment officer at wealth management firm Saltus, said investors should remain disciplined, focusing on long-term positioning rather than short-term movements.

> Nigeria’s easing inflation reading and expectations of an imminent interest rate cut are expected to dominate investor sentiment this week, even as global markets brace for fresh signals from the United States and renewed geopolitical tensions tied to energy prices, Senior Market Analyst at FXTM, Lukman Otunuga, said.
> Latest data showed that headline inflation fell to 15.1 per cent year-on-year in January, down from 15.2 per cent recorded in December, defying analysts’ median expectations of 19.5 per cent by a considerable margin.
> The easing has been largely attributed to a moderation in food prices, which have for years been the most stubborn driver of Nigeria’s inflationary burden on ordinary citizens.
> Market analysts say the inflation slowdown, combined with the naira’s appreciation of roughly eight per cent against the dollar since the start of the year, gives the MPC more room to adjust rates. The central bank had held its benchmark rate at 27 per cent in its last meeting in November, citing the need to stabilise prices and the currency.
> According to the senior Market Analyst at FXTM, Lukman Otunuga, the focus is no longer on whether rates will be cut, but by how much. He noted that a reduction could offer relief to businesses grappling with elevated borrowing costs, while also testing the resilience of the currency and foreign investor appetite.      
> Beyond Nigeria, global markets are entering the week in a cautious mood, he said, adding that the dollar has traded in a tight range, oil prices are searching for direction and cryptocurrency markets are remaining volatile after sharp year-to-date losses.
> Attention is turning to diplomatic talks between the United States and Iran, a development that could influence crude oil prices, which have already climbed more than 10 per cent this year on geopolitical risk.
> Bitcoin, which has fallen more than 20 per cent since January, is hovering around the $70,000 mark, with analysts warning that further weakness could trigger accelerated sell-offs, Otunuga said.Related NewsInflation outlook improves slightly as energy, FX pressures lingerRewane sees inflation averaging 16% this yearNESG projects 5.5% growth, 16% inflation in 2026, warns against policy reversals

### 3. [British beef farmers face double hit from changing climate](https://www.ft.com/content/49aedd71-6e96-499d-904e-60b167697bdb)
**Source**: Financial Times | **Date**: 2026-02-18T05:00:00+00:00

> Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.
> British beef farmers face a double blow from the changing climate as relentless rain forces them to keep cows indoors, after last summer’s drought stopped them storing away enough hay for the winter.
> This year’s rain has left grazing fields waterlogged and cattle stuck indoors, with insufficient hay to munch on because last summer was unusually dry — adding to the pressure on farmers also dealing with lower subsidies and volatile energy and feed prices.
> If the rain persists it could eventually put upward pressure on beef prices — which rose 28 per cent last year — alongside global factors such as shrinking herds and growing demand.
> The rain has blown a hole in farmers’ planning because they would normally only bring cattle inside for four to five months over winter, for which they would buy enough feed. As little as two or three extra weeks indoors is a significant extra cost.
> Lucy Eyre, a beef and sheep farmer in Wales, said British producers have had the “worst of both worlds” with “very poor” yields of silage, a feed made from hay, because of the dry summer. And now turning cattle out too early is risky: on saturated ground they “make a mess” and “the grass won’t do as well later”.
> “Having to house livestock for two to three weeks longer might be the difference between making a loss and breaking even for many farmers,” Eyre said.
> The episode shows how the changing climate can weigh on farmers’ profits and eventually feed through to diets and consumer wallets. Food price inflation has proved stubborn in the UK, and rising grocery bills remain politically charged. Food and non-alcoholic beverage prices rose about 4.5 per cent in the year to December 2025 — an acceleration on the previous month, even as overall inflation eased.
> David Swales, the interim chief economist of the UK Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board, said tight supplies of beef globally, including a declining herd size in the UK, had pushed up prices, but the bad weather could exacerbate the problem.
> “It’s been very wet the last two months — if it carries on as wet as this, it could be very disruptive, and it could add a lot to farmers’ cost of production in the year ahead,” he said. “And this could mean further down the line that food prices have to rise.”
> While the weather in Britain would not have an impact on the global market, not all beef is easily swapped for imports. Swales said “100 per cent British” pledges by supermarkets and restaurant chains such as McDonald’s meant their prices were more likely to be affected by the weather.
> The AHDB said UK beef production in 2025 was 3.5 per cent lower than the year before due to shrinking cattle herds. It expects production to fall again in 2026 and close 1.3 per cent lower than 2025.
> David Barton, chair of the National Farmers’ Union Livestock Board, said wet weather “shouldn’t have much impact on beef supply . . . So long as we have good weather late March into April all should be fine.” He argued that global supply and demand imbalances were causing price rises.
> Cattle numbers have been falling in Britain and abroad. In the US, drought across key cattle states has led to herds falling to their lowest levels in decades, driving up prices.
> Imports to the UK also fell last year, down 3 per cent year on year due to tight supply in Ireland, which accounted for 62 per cent of all beef imports last year. Irish producers have been losing share of the UK market to cheaper suppliers from Brazil, Australia and New Zealand.
> But greater imports could also have an impact on the national diet. “There’s two different kinds of beef,” said Tim Hayward, author of Steak: The Whole Story and an FT columnist.
> “There’s the stuff that runs to the American standards, which is grown now pretty much all over the world, with restricted roaming and feeding on corn, and that gives you fat, soft beef, very, very quickly.” And then there is beef grown in the UK: “We tend to grass finish our animals over here . . . If there is a reduction in the UK herd, and we’re doing more importation, it would be more importation of the crap beef.”

### 4. [Industry experts react as UK inflation cools to 3% amid growing pressure for a March rate cut](https://ifamagazine.com/industry-experts-react-as-uk-inflation-cools-to-3-amid-growing-pressure-for-a-march-rate-cut/)
**Source**: IFA Magazine | **Date**: 2026-02-18T10:04:00+00:00

> UK inflation has fallen to 3.0% in the 12 months to January, down from 3.4% previously and marking its lowest level since March last year. Core inflation has eased to 3.1%, while prices declined by 0.5% on the month, adding to signs that price pressures are continuing to cool.
> The slowdown has been driven by lower energy costs, softer goods price inflation and moderating wage growth. Services inflation has also edged down to 4.4%, a closely watched measure that suggests underlying pressures are gradually easing.
> With the labour market weakening and growth subdued, expectations are rising that the Bank of England could cut interest rates as soon as March. However, policymakers are likely to look for further consistent evidence of cooling inflation before acting.
> Experts are reacting to the latest inflation data below:
> Jonathan Raymond, investment manager at Quilter Cheviot:
> “Hot on the heels of yesterday’s dire UK labour market print, this morning’s inflation data will be a welcome relief. Headline CPI came in at 3.0% in the 12 months to January, down from 3.4% previously, with a monthly fall of 0.5%. Core inflation – which strips out energy, food, alcohol and tobacco – fell to 3.1%, slightly ahead of expectations of 3.0% but a good sign of softening nonetheless. This brings inflation to its lowest level since March last year and makes the Bank of England’s forecast of a sharp return to target over the coming months seem much more achievable.
> “A combination of falling energy costs, easing goods price inflation and moderating wage pressures is helping pull overall inflation lower. Crucially, services inflation, which has proven stubborn for several years and had ticked up once again at the end of last year, also looks to be softening. It came in at 4.4% down from 4.5% previously and, given it has been a component closely watched by the Bank, this will be particularly welcome.
> “As the economy barely kept afloat towards the end of last year, and the labour market and wage growth have cooled considerably, the Bank will likely feel increasingly comfortable cutting rates as 2026 progresses. Following a hold at its first interest rate decision of the year, which saw a tight 5-4 vote split, the monetary policy committee is now facing renewed calls for a cut when it next meets in March. Many economists expect a 0.25% reduction next month, followed by another later in the year.
> “That said, the Bank will want to see a consistent run of softer data before declaring the battle against inflation won. One-off changes to more volatile elements such as airfares, as well as the remaining fallout of the budget, could still be skewing the numbers somewhat. Importantly, the decision announced at the budget to freeze several “regulated” prices – including energy bills and rail fares – should further support disinflation from April onwards, adding to the downward momentum. Nevertheless, today’s figures mark a step in the right direction.
> “If the downward trend continues, the Bank will be under growing pressure to loosen policy to support the economy. However, a rate cut alone may not be enough to meaningfully shift the dial on growth. That said, the latest business surveys offer a glimmer of optimism. January’s PMIs showed a modest pickup across both manufacturing and services, suggesting underlying activity may be stabilising and laying the groundwork for a gradual recovery as the year progresses. Allied to this, lower mortgage rates and some post-budget clarity may help to bring the housing market back to life, providing a much-needed shot in the arm to an important part of the economy.”
> Luke Bartholomew, Deputy Chief Economist, at Abderdeen said;
> “The drop in inflation back to 3% should clear the way for the Bank of England to cut interest rates in March. Granted services inflation was a tad stronger than expected, and this does play an important role in the Bank’s thinking. But with the labour market data yesterday pointing to ongoing weakness in employment and a further softening in pay growth, most policymakers are likely to look through any short run stickiness in the services data. Indeed, inflation is set to fall further in coming months, falling back to 2% in the near future, which should open up further rate cuts later this year.”
> Ben Mitchell, Director of Savings at Chetwood Bank, said:
> “CPI day is often treated as a headline about prices, but for savers it’s really about value. When inflation changes, it alters the real return people earn on their cash, and that can make a massive difference to households in the long term.
> “Over the past few years, many households have become far more engaged with their savings as rates have improved. The latest figures are a useful prompt to check whether that engagement has translated into action. Large sums still sit in accounts paying minimal interest, and even a small gap in rate can make a noticeable difference over time.
> “In the current environment, the fundamentals matter: understand what your money is earning, compare providers rather than defaulting to your main bank, and think carefully about the balance between access and return. Inflation may be easing compared to previous highs, but it remains a factor in financial planning – and savers who review their position regularly are best placed to protect the real value of their money.”
> Adam Gilespie, Partner, XPS Group said:
> “For defined benefit schemes, the direct immediate impact is limited. Most remain well insulated from inflation movements, with aggregate surpluses of around £220 billion. However, a meaningful fall in inflation alters the future protection offered by LDI strategies.
> Without recalibration, schemes risk their inflation hedge slipping – leaving them exposed if price pressures resurface. In a lower‑return environment, keeping inflation and interest rate risks firmly under control is essential, making today’s data another cue for trustees and sponsors to revisit their hedging strategies
> For defined contribution, the focus is shifting from inflation to adequacy. Despite price pressures easing, many savers remain behind the curve. Without higher contributions or stronger long‑term returns, the real value of DC pots will keep eroding. Keeping pace now means boosting contributions where possible and ensuring growth assets deliver over time.”
> Richard Pike, chief sales and marketing officer at Phoebus Software, commented:
> “After December’s surprise hike in inflation, today’s news that inflationary pressures have eased again will come as a welcome relief for households, although with wage growth stagnant, people won’t be feeling much better off.
> “With joblessness rising and wage growth falling, the Bank of England has an important decision to make at its next meeting about whether to use monetary policy to give the country an economic boost. There’s a strong case now for a base rate reduction in March, which would help millions of homeowners and stimulate the property market, helping to drive much-needed growth.”
> Charlie Ambler, Co-Chief Investment Officer, Partner at wealth management firm Saltus, said:
> “While a drop will reassure markets that inflation will follow a downward trajectory over the course of the year, the risk of renewed pressure later in 2026 remains front of mind.
> “Markets are likely to interpret a 3% reading as supportive of the current expectation for gradual rate cuts this year, rather than an acceleration of easing. The Bank has signalled that policy will remain cautious and data dependent, particularly as the impact of Autumn Budget measures – including energy bill support from April – feeds through the economy.
> “For investors, the message remains one of discipline. Short term movements in headline inflation can shift sentiment, but long term returns are driven by maintaining diversified exposure to quality assets. As the rate cycle slowly turns, opportunities will emerge in rate sensitive sectors and selectively within UK equities, but portfolio positioning should remain aligned to long term objectives rather than short term volatility.”
> Mike Ambery, Retirement Savings Director at Standard Life says:
> “Today’s inflation data brings some welcome news, with CPI falling to 3% in January – its lowest level since March 2025 and a clear step down from December’s rebound. The slowdown reflects lower airfare and petrol prices, alongside a cooling in food price rises after sharp increases at the end of last year.
> “With the Bank of England choosing to hold rates at its most recent meeting, today’s figure – along with yesterday’s labour market data, which highlighted a rise in unemployment alongside a slowdown in wage growth – strengthens the case for a cut in March. This comes particularly against the backdrop of subdued economic growth, with GDP expanding by just 0.1% in the final quarter of last year. However, inflation remains above the 2% target and policymakers are likely to want confidence that the improvement is sustained before moving more quickly.
> “For households, today’s easing inflation will bring some relief after several years of price rises and a worrying upward trend across much of 2025. That said, lower inflation doesn’t mean prices are falling – just that they’re rising more slowly – and one month’s data doesn’t guarantee a lasting downward trend. In the near term, borrowers will likely welcome today’s figure and what it means for the prospect of further rate cuts, while those approaching the end of a fixed-rate deal may wish to review their options carefully in light of the changing rate environment.
> “For longer-term savers and those planning for retirement, the core message remains unchanged. Even as inflation stabilises, ensuring savings can keep pace with the cost of living over time is crucial. Investing, including through tax-efficient options like pensions, can offer a better chance of maintaining purchasing power and building financial resilience. For those already drawing an income in retirement, having a clear and balanced plan that provides dependable income while offering some protection against inflation remains essential, whatever the short-term economic backdrop.”
> George Lagarias, Chief Economist at Forvis Mazars comments:
> “Gravity is finally settling in. An economy of sluggish growth, climbing unemployment and softer wage growth, in the eye of a global trade disruption, has absolutely zero reason to be consistently inflationary. The Bank of England still waited for proof and now it has it. We would expect to see faster rate cuts going forward from this point on.”
> Derrick Dunne, CEO of YOU Asset Management has commented:
> “This is a significant slowdown in the rate of inflation and effectively clears the way for the Bank of England to proceed with rate cuts, especially given the broader picture of faltering GDP growth and labour market weakness.
> “Perhaps most crucial in today’s data is that core inflation has now fallen to its lowest level since September 2021. Core inflation has remained stubbornly high for a number of years now and has been one of the main drivers of rate caution from the Monetary Policy Committee in recent decisions.
> “Rate cuts are already priced in by markets, but if employment and GDP figures continue to disappoint then we could see rate cut expectations grow. This could come from additional cuts beyond the two forecast in March and June or from larger cuts to get ahead of the economic slowdown.
> “For households and businesses this is a positive moment and should herald increasing consumer confidence. It is now incumbent on the Government to ensure it does not change fiscal policy in ways that reignite price rises. But it would seem that the one-off pass through effects of minimum wage hikes, public sector pay increase and National Insurance increases from 2025 are now dissipating.
> “Anyone unsure what this could mean for their long-term financial plans should consider consulting with a financial planner.”
> Jonathan Moyes, Head of Investment Research, Wealth Club, commented:
> “Inflation took a step lower today, but fell short of breaking into the 2% range.
> We are going to be hearing a lot about base effects this year. Big inflationary spikes from energy, employers’ national insurance, and the private school fee VAT hike from earlier in 2025 that should roll out of the 12-month window for inflation as we move through 2026. This will have a cooling effect on inflation, and we should see inflation fall back to 2% this year.
> On the back of weak employment and wage growth data from yesterday, there would have been many revising their expectations for inflation overnight. Instead, inflation came in bang in line with expectations. The market reaction is expected to be muted as a result.
> What does all this mean for the Bank of England? The next meeting is on 19 March. With a deteriorating labour market, weak wages, weak economic growth, and no ugly surprises on inflation, it is likely we will see our first rate cut of 2026. The economy may need several more before it begins to show signs of life. For an embattled government starved of good news, they couldn’t come soon enough.”
> Rob Morgan, Chief Investment Analyst at Charles Stanley, Part of Raymond James Wealth Management, comments:
> “With growth stuck at stall speed, business investment subdued, and consumers becoming more cautious, the case for the Bank of England to do more of the heavy lifting through monetary policy grows stronger.
> UK inflation eased to 3.0% in January 2026, confirming December’s 3.2% reading as a something of a blip. The broader trend now points to price growth gradually returning toward the Bank of England’s 2% target in the coming months, providing some relief for households that have been battling rapidly escalating day-to-today costs.
> The stubborn inflationary pressures seen last year are finally receding. Budget‑driven tax rises and a cooling labour market are set to bear down on prices, particularly if wage growth softens further. At the same time, lower rail fares and falling energy prices are set to add to the downward pressure.
> Borrowers are set to benefit from receding price rises too. With UK growth still flatlining, policymakers are likely to shift more decisively toward supporting a fragile economy through additional interest rate cuts – a tilt already visible in February’s narrow Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) vote to hold. Emerging cracks evident in the labour market, alongside other weakening economic indicators, only reinforces that view.”
> Caitlyn Eastell, Personal Finance Analyst at Moneyfactscompare.co.uk, said:
> “Savers have lost almost £1,200 on average in real terms over the past five years, despite savings rates hitting post-2008 highs, as inflation surged to over 40-year peaks and ate away at the value of cash savings. While the top non-ISA savings accounts currently boast higher headline rates, the tax-free interest offered by cash ISAs could leave many savers even better off in real terms, particularly those at risk of breaching their Personal Savings Allowance. However, with inflation set to cool, savers could soon choose from a larger pool of products that offer inflation-busting returns even with potential base rate cuts looming because inflation is falling faster than savings rates.
> “Unsurprisingly, the deals that have suffered the biggest blows over the past month are those with shorter fixed terms or variable rates, suggesting that the window to secure competitive rates is closing as providers could already be pricing in future rate cuts. The top long-term ISAs and non-ISAs currently offer around 4.50%, therefore they may become an increasingly attractive option in the fading rate environment, as they guarantee set returns and can help with future planning. However, these deals may not be for everyone, and savers should carefully balance the appeal of certainty against their need for access.”
> Danni Hewson, AJ Bell head of financial analysis, comments:
> “The latest inflation figures are encouraging, although they effectively turn the clock back to where we were a year ago, before the impact of Rachel Reeves’ first Budget and Donald Trump’s trade skirmishes made their mark.
> “For households, it’s important to remember that prices are still going up, it’s just that they’re not going up by as much as they were throughout most of 2025. But with wage growth now cooling, every little fall will really help.
> “Digging into today’s numbers it’s everyday costs which are making an impact. Prices at the pump have fallen considerably and airfares have largely reversed the increases which helped push up inflation in December.
> “There’s also good news about the weekly shop, with the price of some staples like bread, meat and cheese falling. However, if you’re after the convenience of a takeaway you’ll be paying a bit more.
> “For the Bank of England, the latest data could give a green light for an interest rate cut in March, with market expectation for a cut rounding off at 85% after today’s release. The last time members of the MPC met the vote was split 5-4 to hold rates steady versus a cut to 3.5%, and the plethora of recent data should be more than enough to give at least one member a good shove to the other side of the seesaw.
> “There’s growing expectation that economic conditions might be in such a way that the Bank can deliver not two but three rate cuts this year, although that’s far from nailed on. The Bank’s rate setters will be acutely aware that service sector inflation is still stubbornly high at 4.3% and January’s headline rate of 3% is slightly above the Bank’s own forecast.”
> Laurence Booth, Global Head of Markets, CMC Markets, said:
> “Today’s CPI release strengthens the case for further easing, with headline inflation now at its lowest level in nearly a year.
> “While services inflation remains relatively firm, the broader direction of travel keeps the Bank of England on course toward its 2% target.
> “Sterling has failed to draw support from the release, with GBP/USD holding around 1.3570, as markets focus on the policy implications rather than the headline print.
> “Combined with weaker labour market data earlier this week, the latest figures materially increase the likelihood of a March rate cut, with Bank Rate expectations gravitating toward 3.5%.”
> Emma Wall, Chief Investment Strategist, Hargreaves Lansdown
> “UK inflation has fallen to 3% for the month of January, down from 3.4% the previous month, according to the Office of National Statistics. Lower fuel and airfares helped ease pricing pressures, as did slower inflation for food and non-alcoholic drinks. Core inflation, which excludes the often-volatile prices of food, energy and alcohol also fell on the previous month, as did services inflation, which has been sticky on the last year. These measures moving in tandem suggests that the outlook from here will be lower inflation, and the Bank of England expects inflation to fall to the target of 2% this year. The welcome news comes following yesterday’s weaker jobs data, meaning a March rate cut now looks certain.
> “Last time the Monetary Policy Committee met, the vote was split 5-4 to hold rates vs cut them, so the market trajectory is not a surprise – what will be key is the cadence and velocity from here. We expect that the MPC will cut twice this year, having favoured a cautious approach. Markets looking for forward guidance will no doubt place emphasis on the rhetoric from Bank of England Governor, Andrew Bailey, in the press conference following next month’s decision.
> “Gilt yields have fallen over recent days, with the 10-year dropping below 4.4% having been above 4.5% at the end of last week. As well as supportive UK data, there is also some contagion from the US, where the 10-year Treasury yield has fallen by nearly 20 basis points since the start of last week.
> What does this mean for savers and investors?
> “Short-dated Gilt yields are certainly lower than they were a year ago – and should inflation continue to ease, this is supportive of lower rates, which presents opportunities for active traders, or indeed investors who want to lock in higher rates of income now. Lower yields and lower inflation are also broadly supportive for equities, as pricing pressures – particularly energy costs – have weighted on corporates. However, jobs data and economic growth will be key here; any signs of economic weakness could spook markets and cause businesses to put the brakes on expansion, whether that means hiring or spending.
> “Savers who can should lock in higher rates of interest now, as fixed term products are likely to quickly reflect the market trajectory. Using a savings platform will help consumers ensure they are getting the best rates on the market from a range of providers.”
> Kevin Brown, savings expert at Scottish Friendly, has commented:
> “Many households will welcome this morning’s inflation figure of 3%, as it suggests December’s uptick was not the start of a renewed trend upwards.
> “It seems now the journey back towards the Bank of England’s 2% target has regained momentum. That matters not only for policymakers considering rate cuts, but for households whose financial planning depends on the direction of prices.
> “The key point, however, is that inflation easing is not the same as inflation disappearing. Even at 3%, prices are still rising meaningfully year on year. Compounded over time, that continues to shape the real value of savings.
> “For borrowers, this strengthens the case for the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee to trim rates in March. For savers, the picture becomes more nuanced. As inflation falls, interest rates are also likely to continue to ease, which could narrow the window for locking in attractive cash returns.
> “Cash provides stability and plays an essential role in short-term planning. But when inflation is persistent, preserving purchasing power over the long term may require looking beyond cash alone. Considering investing can be one way to potentially help savings keep working over time, rather than gradually losing ground.”

> Technology stocks moved back in favour.
> After a third positive session on Wednesday, ASX200 futures are pointing to a rise above the 9000-index level.
> The Australian market rose for a third straight session, up 48 points or 0.5% with technology up 2.3% and materials the only laggard, down -0.2%.

> The FNArena Corporate Results Monitor has 83 assessments to date (as per yesterday): https://fnarena.com/index.php/reporting_season/
> Equity markets rose, led by tech stocks following strong US data. The S&P500 rose 0.56% while technology was back in favour pushing the Nasdaq up 0.78%.
> US indices did dip after the release of the Federal Reserve minutes.
> The EuroStoxx50 ended its session up 1.4% while the FTSE100 gained 1.2%. The yield on the US 10y note rose around 1.1bp to 4.08%.
> US Durable goods orders fell -1.4% m/m in December following a 5.4% m/m lift in November. Excluding transport equipment, orders rose 0.9% m/m. Core capital goods orders rose 0.6% m/m, with gains broad-based, although equipment tied to AI-related investment continued to be a key driver.
> Data show there was robust capital investment to the end of 2025. Industrial production rose 0.7% m/m in January, the strongest monthly gain in a year. Production tied to the AI-driven investment boom saw strong growth, with computer equipment and semiconductors rising over 2% m/m.
> UK headline inflation slowed -0.4ppt to 3.0% y/y in January, matching the consensus. Transport, reflecting lower fuel prices, and food were the largest contributors to the decline. The latter will be welcomed by the Bank of England, given the impact of food prices on household inflation expectations, about which some members of the MPC have expressed concerns.
> Core inflation eased marginally to 3.1% y/y from 3.2% y/y, a touch above the consensus. Services inflation also eased slightly, to 4.4% y/y from 4.5% y/y
> January’s UK inflation release alongside yesterday’s soft labour market release supports the case for a March rate cut. After disinflation progress stalled in the first half of 2025, the downtrend has re-established across components.
> Disinflation is set to accelerate over the coming months, owing to base effects. While services inflation has proven sticky, rising labour market slack and slowing wage growth point to further progress.
> We think concerns regarding inflation’s persistence among the hawkish members of the MPC are inconsistent with a forward-looking approach to policy. Economic growth is lacklustre, and the labour market is deteriorating.
> The unemployment rate rose to 5.2% in the three months to December, its highest level in a decade, while the number of payrolled employees fell for the fifth straight month. We forecast three -25bp cuts delivered quarterly, starting from March, to take the bank rate to 3.0%.
> Crude oil prices rose on investor concerns over the final agreement between the US and Iran, which hinges on a potential nuclear deal. Iran is expected to present a comprehensive proposal within the next two weeks, while a report suggested American military intervention could come sooner than expected.
> Elsewhere, President Zelenskyy has accused Russia of delaying peace talks. Operations at Russian refineries have been disrupted by Ukrainian air strikes, resulting in increased crude oil exports.
> Russian oil production also declined towards the end of last year following attacks on oil infrastructure. A prevailing risk-on sentiment in the market helped prices to move higher.
> European natural gas pared recent losses, as traders fear disruptions to gas flows if Iran closes the Strait of Hormuz. While forecasts of warmer weather increase the prospect of softening demand, investors are watching depleted European gas inventories which are now at 34%, their lowest since 2022. Gas flows remain steady despite production outages in Norway.
> Renewable power generation is picking up in Germany, with mild weather helping solar power generation, with strong winds supporting wind power generation.
> Gold rose above US$5,000/oz amid renewed geopolitical concerns. Buyers took advantage of the price drop ahead of the release of the Federal Reserve’s meeting minutes. Strong economic data suggest a hawkish tilt, but the market will be closely watching the Fed’s stance on rates. Speculative positions are lean, and fresh longs can return as structural drivers are still in place.
> Silver prices jumped to US$78/oz. Year-to-date, -69moz of silver moved out of COMEX to other trading hubs, easing spot market tightness.
> Copper recouped losses by gaining more than 2%, as strong economic data bolstered market sentiment. US industrial production increased in January by the most in nearly a year. Housing starts rose to a five-month high, supporting demand prospects for industrial metals.
> Aluminium traded above US$3,000/t. The US is considering to changing its broad tariffs on steel and aluminium, this will see trade flows normalising.
> Iron ore fell to US$95/t in Singapore amid rising iron ore inventories and falling steel production. Steel output in China declined by over -4% to roughly 961mt last year. Domestic demand has been dented by the ongoing property crisis, but steel mills have increased exports in an effort to compensate for the downturn.
> On the other hand, Australia and Brazil are boosting their production, while the start of Simandou project will add to production over the years.
> I walked into 2026 thinking we were at the end of the beginning phase of the artificial intelligence trade. It turns out we were not even through the warm-up lap.
> The market is no longer debating whether AI matters. The debate is whether the payoff curve bends steeply enough to justify the most aggressive capital cycle since the post-war build-out of the interstate highway system.
> The beginning phase is just starting. The game is accelerating. And the tape is now circling one central question on its probability pad. Is this a compounding flywheel or a capital sinkhole?
> Start with the physical footprint. The data centre boom has moved from a thematic story to a macro variable. These are no longer industrial sheds with blinking lights. They are balance sheet devourers. Single campuses now carry price tags north of US$20 billion. Construction pipelines are tilting around them. Power grids are being stress tested. Transformers are becoming strategic assets.
> Electricity is the new oil of this cycle. Goldman estimates power demand tied to AI growing at 17% annually through 2028. That is not incremental. That is structural.
> The constraint is no longer imagination. It is amperage. Grid connection queues are stretching. Tier one hubs such as London, Dublin, Amsterdam and Frankfurt are congested. Capital is migrating to secondary markets across Europe as hyperscalers chase electrons the way shale drillers once chased acreage.
> The United States remains the epicentre. Europe is playing catch-up with pipelines up sharply year on year. Yet here is the nuance the market is digesting. Data centres are a powerful construction impulse, but they do not immunize the broader sector from high rates, labour scarcity and stubborn input costs.
> This is a capital-intensive build-out layered on top of a fragile financing backdrop. If liquidity tightens, the cranes slow.
> Which leads directly to the second axis of risk. Revenues versus investment.
> By some estimates, nearly US$2 trillion has already been deployed in this AI arms race. Big tech capex is set to exceed US$630 billion this year alone. For context, the Apollo programme that put a man on the moon cost less in real terms. We are funding the equivalent of a digital moonshot every twelve months.
> For now, demand for advanced chips is described as sky-high. The order books are full. But free cash flow growth at the hyperscaler level is beginning to feel the strain. Debt-funded capex is rising. The market is making a forward bet that monetization will bend sharply higher.
> If revenues outrun investment, the equity multiple expansion holds. If they lag, the market will start asking harder questions about return on invested capital.
> This is where positioning matters. AI stocks have driven the bulk of index level performance since ChatGPT detonated onto the scene. The S&P has effectively become a referendum on silicon productivity. When three quarters of index returns are concentrated in one theme the index stops being diversified and starts being directional.
> That does not mean the trade is wrong. It means it is crowded. And crowded trades do not collapse because the story fails. They wobble when the marginal buyer hesitates.
> Now layer in the third dimension. Healthcare.
> This is where the narrative shifts from capex spectacle to societal utility. The global healthcare system is short millions of workers. Billions lack access to essential services. Here AI moves from hype to tool. Diagnostic models that scan X rays and CT images. Retinal analysis that flags diabetic complications early. ECG pattern recognition that surfaces cardiac risk.
> These systems do not replace clinicians. They compress time. And in medicine time is margin.
> If AI meaningfully lifts productivity in healthcare the economic dividend is profound. Fewer administrative hours. Faster triage. Earlier detection. That is not just revenue. That is cost deflation in one of the most inflation-prone sectors on earth.
> The market understands this intuitively. It is why the narrative has broadened from chips to applications. From infrastructure to outcomes. The first wave was shovel sales. The second wave is operating leverage.
> We are no longer pricing a technology story. We are pricing an ecosystem. Power grids, bond markets, labour markets, hospital workflows and sovereign balance sheets are now tethered to the AI cycle. This is not a sector rotation. It is a capital reallocation across the real economy.
> The key question for 2026 is not whether AI is transformative. It is whether cash flow transformation keeps pace with capital formation. If revenues begin to outrun the spend, this becomes the defining growth engine of the decade. If debt rises faster than monetization, the market will begin to circle not the opportunity but the vulnerability.
> For now the tape is not circling the drain. It is circling a launch pad. But launch pads are unforgiving places. They reward execution and punish miscalculation.
> The AI supercycle has only just cleared its throat. The next move will determine whether it sings in compounding harmony or strains under the weight of its own ambition.

## 📌 Topic: China's Economic Outlook (Growth, Consumption, EU-China Relations)
*(Found 3 articles)*

### 1. [EU-China Relations in 2026: What to Watch](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/eu-china-relations-in-2026-what-to-watch/)
**Source**: China Briefing | **Date**: 2026-02-18T12:28:00+00:00

> After a turbulent 2025 marked by trade frictions and rare earth disruptions, EU-China relations enter 2026 in a phase of cautious engagement rather than reset. Diplomatic channels have reopened and trade flows remain broadly resilient, providing a degree of stability for businesses. At the same time, structural imbalances, regulatory differences, and economic security considerations continue to shape the relationship and will remain key variables for EU-China ties in 2026.
> After a volatile 2025 in which expectations of an EU-China reset briefly rose and then collapsed, relations entering 2026 are defined less by renewed trust than by an effort to avoid further disruption. The rare earth export restrictions imposed by China in the second half of 2025 left a lasting mark on European policymakers, reinforcing the sense that the relationship has entered a “do no harm” phase: that is, one in which engagement continues, but escalation is carefully avoided.
> This cautious posture is unfolding against a more unsettled transatlantic backdrop. US President Donald Trump’s return to office has injected renewed uncertainty into Europe’s external environment, pushing several European leaders to seek diplomatic and commercial reassurance in Beijing. Yet beneath the flurry of high-level visits, the structural issues that have driven EU-China tensions over recent years remain firmly in place.
> These include widening trade imbalances, persistent concerns over industrial overcapacity, growing unease over economic coercion risks, and China’s continued alignment with Russia. As 2026 begins, the central question is not whether EU-China relations will stabilize at the surface (they largely have) but whether this stability can endure as economic security considerations increasingly shape policy choices on both sides.
> The year 2026 also follows closely on the 50th anniversary of EU-China diplomatic relations, a milestone that underscored both the depth of economic interdependence and the limits of political convergence. Together, the EU and China account for close to 30 percent of global trade, yet the relationship has become increasingly defined by the EU’s own formulation of China as simultaneously a partner, a competitor, and a systemic rival.
> While the anniversary encouraged diplomatic restraint and rhetorical moderation, it did little to resolve the underlying frictions. If anything, it highlighted a paradox that is likely to define 2026: the EU and China remain too economically intertwined for confrontation to be cost-free, but too politically and structurally misaligned for a meaningful reset to take hold.
> To understand the trajectory of EU-China relations in 2026, it is necessary to start with China’s economic position. China enters the year more resilient than many expected after renewed tariff pressure and external headwinds in 2025. However, this resilience has not been cost-free. Sustained industrial output, supported by credit, subsidies, and policy guidance, has reinforced China’s dependence on exports at a time when domestic consumption remains subdued.
> For trading partners, including the EU, this has translated into a phenomenon increasingly described as “exported deflation”: compressed prices, intense competition, and rising pressure on domestic industries. China’s trade surplus surpassed the US$1 trillion mark in 2025, and Europe’s share of that imbalance has become politically salient. The concern in Brussels is no longer limited to volume, but increasingly focused on composition, particularly the growing weight of advanced manufactured goods that compete directly with Europe’s own reindustrialization ambitions in clean technology, automotive supply chains, and advanced machinery.
> In this sense, Europe is not merely observing China’s resilience; it is absorbing part of its cost.
> Based on the latest full-year data available, China remains the EU’s second-largest trading partner for goods and its third-largest trading partner overall when goods and services are combined, after the US and the UK. In 2024, bilateral trade in goods reached approximately EUR 732 billion (US$785.8 billion), reflecting the continued depth of economic interdependence between the two economies.
> At the same time, the aggregate figures mask a relationship that European policymakers increasingly describe as structurally imbalanced. The EU’s trade deficit in goods with China amounted to EUR 305.8 billion (US$350 billion) in 2024, widening from EUR 297 billion in 2023, though still below the record EUR 397.3 billion (US$468 billion) reached in 2022. In volume terms, the imbalance has continued to deepen: between 2015 and 2024, the EU’s trade deficit with China quadrupled by volume while only doubling in value, underscoring the growing weight of high-volume, low-margin imports.
> The composition of trade has become central to the debate. In 2024, manufactured goods accounted for 96.7 percent of EU imports from China, dominated by machinery and vehicles, which made up 55 percent of total imports, followed by other manufactured goods at 34 percent and chemicals at 8 percent. EU exports to China are similarly concentrated in manufactured products, which accounted for 86.9 percent of total exports, led again by machinery and vehicles at 51 percent, chemicals at 17 percent, and other manufactured goods at 20 percent. This overlap has intensified competitive pressure, particularly as the EU seeks to rebuild industrial capacity in sectors that increasingly mirror China’s export strengths.
> While goods trade remains the most politically sensitive dimension of the relationship, services and investment flows provide a more differentiated picture. The EU has long maintained a surplus in services trade with China, which stood at EUR 21.7 billion (US$25.59 billion) in 2024, and China remains the EU’s fourth-largest services trading partner. Investment ties also remain significant in both directions.
> The EU’s investment stock in China stood at EUR 232 billion (US$273.64 billion) in 2023, with EU foreign direct investment (FDI) flows reaching EUR 10.1 billion (US$11.91 billion) in 2024, concentrated primarily in the automotive, basic materials, and information and communication technology sectors. Chinese foreign direct investment into the EU rose to EUR 9.4 billion (US$11.08 billion) in 2024, increasingly driven by greenfield projects rather than mergers and acquisitions.
> Although comprehensive full-year trade data for 2025 has yet to be released, developments over the past year suggest that the underlying structure of the relationship has remained broadly intact. Trade volumes have proven resilient, but concerns over reciprocity, market access asymmetries, and the spillover effects of China’s industrial policy have moved further to the centre of EU trade policy debates.
> For 2026, this combination of scale and imbalance sets clear constraints on policy choices. Trade volumes remain too large, and investment links too embedded, for disengagement to be economically viable. At the same time, the size and composition of the imbalance make political inaction increasingly difficult to sustain, ensuring that trade relations remain a central pressure point in the broader EU-China relationship.
> Also read: China’s Import-Export in 2025: Full-Year Data, Trends, and 2026 Outlook
> Trade between China and the European Union has developed over several decades into one of the world’s most consequential economic relationships, spanning manufacturing, agriculture, technology, and consumer goods. This depth reflects genuine interdependence between the two economies, but it has also ensured that periods of economic slowdown or geopolitical tension tend to translate quickly into trade friction.
> Historically, EU-China trade relations have oscillated between pragmatic cooperation and cautious rivalry, shaped by divergent regulatory systems, industrial structures, and strategic priorities. These differences have not prevented sustained engagement, but they have consistently limited the scope for durable alignment, particularly during periods of stress.
> The renewed focus on bilateral trade entering 2026 follows a series of targeted policy recalibrations by Chinese authorities affecting select European exports, alongside intensified diplomatic engagement in Brussels. While neither side has framed these developments as concessions, market observers widely interpret them as pragmatic adjustments aimed at stabilizing trade flows in a more fragile global environment.
> Brussels has emerged as the focal point for this engagement. Discussions involving EU trade officials, policy advisors, and industry representatives have centred on tariff structures, regulatory transparency, and dispute-resolution mechanisms. Diplomats familiar with the talks describe them as technical and measured, underscoring a shared interest in managing friction rather than redefining the relationship.
> The cautious tone of engagement is shaped in part by economic pressures on both sides. Slowing growth, rising production costs, and shifting consumer demand have increased sensitivity to trade disruptions, prompting policymakers to reassess how existing trade tools are deployed.
> From Beijing’s perspective, trade policy adjustments are closely linked to domestic priorities, including employment stability, industrial upgrading, and consumer price management. Measures affecting European imports are therefore best understood as part of a broader effort to balance domestic production with demand for higher-quality foreign goods, rather than as signals of strategic realignment.
> At the same time, regulatory divergence remains a structural constraint. Differences in certification standards, environmental requirements, and compliance procedures continue to generate friction even in the absence of tariff changes, limiting the scope for materially smoother trade relations.
> European industry has responded cautiously. Manufacturers and exporters acknowledge incremental progress but continue to emphasize the need for predictability to support long-term planning and investment. Uncertainty surrounding regulatory treatment, market access, and compliance requirements continues to weigh on decisions related to production capacity, supply chain configuration, and market expansion.
> Against a volatile global trade backdrop marked by supply chain realignments and geopolitical uncertainty, both the EU and China appear to view stability as preferable to renewed confrontation. This does not eliminate the risk of escalation, trade remedies, investigations, or political disputes could still alter momentum quickly. For 2026, however, the prevailing approach is one of cautious management: preserving channels, containing disputes, and avoiding decisions that would be difficult to reverse.
> If previous years were defined by conceptual debates around “de-risking versus decoupling,” 2026 is shaping up to be a year of implementation. The EU’s policy trajectory suggests a move away from new slogans and toward the enforcement of existing tools, particularly in sectors exposed to overcapacity and state support.
> This enforcement-driven approach reflects both political reality and institutional constraint. Rather than pursuing sweeping trade restrictions, Brussels is increasingly focused on measures that are legally defensible, procedurally grounded, and compatible with the EU’s broader regulatory framework. These include trade defense actions, subsidy scrutiny, and targeted customs interventions.
> A notable example is the decision to introduce a fixed customs duty on low-value parcels from July 1, 2026, aimed at addressing the surge of inexpensive e-commerce imports. While framed as a consumer protection and compliance measure, it also reflects growing concern about the cumulative impact of low-cost imports (many linked to China) on European retailers and manufacturers.
> For businesses, the signal is clear: regulatory friction is likely to become more granular, more technical, and more persistent, rather than dramatic or headline-driven.
> Another regulatory development likely to shape EU-China trade in 2026 is the implementation and planned expansion of the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). Having entered into force on January 1, 2026, the mechanism applies carbon pricing to imports of steel, aluminium, cement, fertilizers, electricity, and hydrogen, with proposals under consideration to extend its scope from 2028 to downstream steel- and aluminium-intensive goods such as machinery and household appliances.
> For China, which remains a dominant supplier of steel, aluminium, and manufactured goods incorporating these materials, CBAM introduces a new layer of compliance and cost exposure. Chinese authorities have criticized the EU’s use of baseline carbon-intensity values and have framed the proposed expansion as carrying protectionist implications. At the same time, the mechanism aligns in part with China’s own industrial decarbonization trajectory, reinforcing pressure on exporters to improve emissions reporting, adopt cleaner production processes, and accelerate green upgrading.
> In this sense, CBAM encapsulates the evolving character of EU-China economic engagement: formally grounded in climate objectives, but carrying significant implications for competitiveness, market access, and industrial policy alignment. As implementation progresses, its practical impact will depend less on rhetoric than on how verification standards, default values, and sectoral coverage are operationalized.
> The rare earth episode of 2025 remains one of the most consequential developments shaping EU-China relations in 2026. China’s ability to impose, expand, and suspend export controls on materials essential to Europe’s digital, defense, and green industries exposed a vulnerability that diversification efforts have yet to resolve.
> In response, the EU continues to anchor its long-term strategy in the Critical Raw Materials Act, which aims to diversify imports, support strategic projects, and improve monitoring of supply risks. However, progress has been slow, and recent assessments suggest that Europe’s dependence on external suppliers (particularly China) will persist well into the second half of the decade.
> This reality has tempered the EU’s appetite for escalation. Even as policymakers emphasize the need to reduce strategic dependencies, the experience of 2025 has reinforced a preference for stabilization where critical inputs are concerned. For China, meanwhile, rare earths and other critical materials have proven to be effective leverage, tools that can be adjusted without fully severing trade ties.
> Beyond Europe, China’s expanding footprint in the Global South adds another layer of complexity to EU-China relations. China’s deepening engagement in regions such as Latin America and Africa (particularly in critical raw materials) directly intersects with Europe’s own diversification ambitions.
> Latin America, for example, is central to the global supply of lithium and copper, materials that are critical to Europe’s energy transition. Chinese firms have secured significant stakes in mining assets across the region, positioning China as both a supplier and an intermediary in value chains the EU is seeking to diversify.
> This competitive dynamic complicates Europe’s external strategy, as efforts to reduce dependence on China increasingly run up against China’s growing presence elsewhere.
> Geopolitics continues to cast a long shadow over EU-China relations. China’s relationship with Russia remains a central source of tension, particularly as the EU maintains sanctions and monitors circumvention risks linked to the war in Ukraine. For European policymakers, the issue is not only legal compliance but credibility: China’s claim to be a responsible global actor sits uneasily alongside its economic and diplomatic alignment with Russia.
> In 2026, this dynamic is unlikely to disappear. Even if diplomatic rhetoric softens, sanctions enforcement and reputational concerns will continue to limit the scope for political rapprochement. For Beijing, managing this balance (maximizing strategic benefits while containing reputational costs) will remain a delicate task.
> For European companies operating in or with China, the cumulative effect of these trends is an environment defined by uncertainty rather than crisis. China remains a critical market and manufacturing base, but geopolitical risk is increasingly treated as a structural feature of doing business rather than an episodic disruption.
> Surveys suggest that while expectations for China’s technological progress (particularly in areas such as AI) remain high, confidence in stable EU-China relations is considerably lower. This divergence has practical implications. Companies are placing greater emphasis on localization, supplier diversification, and regulatory monitoring, particularly in sectors exposed to trade defense actions or critical input constraints.
> Rather than exiting China, many firms are recalibrating their exposure, embedding geopolitical risk more explicitly into long-term planning and investment decisions.
> Several developments are likely to serve as indicators of how the relationship evolves over the year:
> EU-China relations in 2026 are unlikely to deliver either a reset or a rupture. The more plausible outcome is managed competition: continued engagement constrained by economic security logic and geopolitical risk. While diplomatic stability may offer businesses breathing room, the underlying drivers of tension remain close to the surface.
> For companies, the implication is clear. Even in periods of relative calm, EU-China relations will continue to shape market access, supply chains, and investment strategies in ways that require sustained attention and careful risk management.

> NEW YORK, Feb. 17, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Genco Shipping & Trading Limited (NYSE:GNK) ("Genco" or the "Company"), the largest U.S. headquartered drybulk shipowner focused on the global transportation of commodities, today reported its financial results for the three months and twelve months ended December 31, 2025.
> Fourth Quarter 2025 and Year-to-Date Highlights
> John C. Wobensmith, Chief Executive Officer, commented, "During 2025, we made notable progress executing our comprehensive value strategy, as we provided shareholders with sizeable returns and invested in our fleet to further expand Genco's earnings and dividend power. Drawing on our significant cash flow in Q4, we declared a multi-year high dividend of $0.50 per share, which marks the Company's 26th consecutive dividend and the longest uninterrupted period in our drybulk peer group. Including the Q4 payment, total dividends to shareholders over the past 6.5 years will increase to $7.565 per share, or 34% of our current share price. Complementing this sizeable return of capital, we have continued to take advantage of Genco's significant financial strength, investing $343 million in high specification Capesize and Newcastlemax vessels since 2023."
> Mr. Wobensmith continued, "The deliberate steps we have executed upon to enhance our premium earning asset base, combined with our spot-focused commercial strategy, and one of the industry's lowest cash flow breakeven levels, puts us in an ideal position to capitalize on a strengthening drybulk market. Building on our success generating the highest Q4 TCE and EBITDA levels in three years, Q1 TCE to date represents our highest Q1 level since 2024 and an increase of over 50% year-over-year. Notably, our momentum has continued in Q1 in what has been an unseasonably strong start to the year. Based on our firm fixtures to date, and the continued execution of our value strategy, we expect a higher dividend in Q1 on a year-over-year basis. We remain optimistic on the strength of the drybulk market in 2026 and our well-timed acquisitions of two Newcastlemax vessels expected in Q1 and one Capesize vessel in 2025 have further increased our operating leverage and expanded our dividend capacity."
> Mr. Wobensmith concluded, "Our unrelenting focus continues to be on providing shareholders with sizeable dividends, further growing our high specification premium earning fleet, as well as maintaining our industry leading leverage profile and strong corporate governance standards. With Genco's track record of executing on our stated capital allocation strategy, our high quality and modern fleet, leading commercial operating platform, strong balance sheet, significant operating leverage and best-in-class corporate governance, we are well positioned to deliver value for shareholders in 2026 and beyond."
> 1 Genco share price as of February 13, 2026.
> 2 We believe the non-GAAP measure presented provides investors with a means of better evaluating and understanding the Company's operating performance. Please see Summary Consolidated Financial and Other Data below for further reconciliation. Regarding Q1 2026 TCE, this estimate is based on both period and current spot fixtures, actual results will vary from current estimates. Net revenue is defined as voyage revenues minus voyage expenses, charter hire expenses and realized gains or losses on fuel hedges.
> Genco's consistent comprehensive value strategy is centered on three pillars:
> Key characteristics of our strategy include:
> 3Represents the principal amount of our credit facility debt outstanding less our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2025 divided by estimates of the market value of our fleet as of February 13, 2026 from VesselsValue.com for illustrative purposes only. The actual market value of our vessels may vary.
> We acquired the Genco Courageous, a 2020-built 182,000 dwt scrubber-fitted Capesize vessel, for $63.6 million. We took delivery of the vessel on October 15, 2025. Genco funded the acquisition through a combination of cash on hand and a drawdown from its revolving credit facility.
> Additionally, in November, Genco agreed to acquire two 2020-built 208,000 dwt scrubber-fitted Newcastlemax vessels for a total purchase price of $145.5 million. Genco expects to take delivery of the vessels during March of 2026 and intends to fund the acquisition with cash on hand and a drawdown from its revolving credit facility.
> Furthermore, we have elected to exercise the accordion feature for $80 million under our existing revolving credit facility, increasing our borrowing capacity from $600 million to $680 million. Following the anticipated acquisition of the two Newcastlemax vessels in Q1 2026, we expect to have approximately $330 million of debt outstanding and approximately $350 million of undrawn revolver availability. We also plan to pledge these two vessels as collateral under the facility. Participating lenders in this credit facility upsize include Nordea Bank Abp, New York Branch, Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB (publ), DNB Capital LLC and ING Capital LLC.
> Genco declared a cash dividend of $0.50 per share for the fourth quarter of 2025. The Q4 2025 dividend is payable on or about March 18, 2026 to all shareholders of record as of March 11, 2026.
> Quarterly dividend policy: 100% of quarterly operating cash flow less a voluntary reserve.
> Under the quarterly dividend policy adopted by our Board of Directors, the amount available for quarterly dividends is to be calculated based on the formula in the table below. The table includes the calculation of the actual Q4 2025 dividend and estimated amounts for the calculation of the dividend for Q1 2026:
> Operating cash flow is defined as net revenue (consisting of voyage revenue less voyage expenses, charter hire expenses, and realized gains or losses on fuel hedges), less operating expenses (consisting of vessel operating expenses, general and administrative expenses other than non-cash restricted stock expenses, technical management expenses, and interest expense other than non-cash deferred financing costs), for purposes of the foregoing calculation. Estimated expenses for Q1 2026 are estimates and subject to change.
> The voluntary quarterly reserve for the first quarter of 2026 under the Company's dividend formula is targeted at $19.5 million, which remains fully within our discretion. A key component of Genco's value strategy is maintaining a voluntary quarterly reserve, as well as the optionality for the use of the reserve as Genco seeks to pay sizeable dividends across the cyclicality of the drybulk market while continuing to invest in our fleet. Subject to the development of freight rates for the remainder of the first quarter and our assessment of our liquidity and forward outlook, we maintain flexibility to reduce the quarterly reserve to pay dividends or increase the amount of dividends otherwise payable under our formula. The reserve is set by our Board of Directors at its discretion, and our Board has generally allotted an amount for anticipated debt prepayments plus an additional amount. We plan to set the voluntary reserve on a quarterly basis for the subsequent quarter.
> Anticipated uses for the voluntary reserve include, but are not limited to:
> The Board expects to reassess the payment of dividends as appropriate from time to time. Our quarterly dividend policy and declaration and payment of dividends are subject to legally available funds, compliance with applicable law and contractual obligations (including our credit facility) and the Board of Directors' determination that each declaration and payment is at the time in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders after its review of our financial performance.
> Peter Allen, Chief Financial Officer, commented, "Since implementing our value strategy five years ago, Genco has built a robust balance sheet with a solid risk-reward balance for shareholders aimed at paying sizeable dividends through cycles and growing our fleet and earnings power. Our proven approach of maintaining low financial leverage and high operating leverage, coupled with our active approach to revenue generation, continues to deliver strong results, highlighted by multi-year high TCE and EBITDA in Q4, as well as a firm Q1 TCE to date in what is typically the seasonal low part of the year. From an execution standpoint, we have both expanded our earnings power with the acquisition of three high specification premium earning vessels in 2025 and declared a $0.50 per share dividend in Q4, the highest dividend in three years and an increase of over 200% as compared to the Q3 2025 dividend. With a low net loan to value ratio of 12%, a sub-$10,000 cash flow breakeven level, and $400 million of undrawn revolver availability, Genco continues to operate from a position of strength to take advantage of accretive growth opportunities, while maintaining our commitment to sizable dividends."
> Genco's Active Commercial Operating Platform and Fleet Deployment Strategy
> We utilize a portfolio approach towards revenue generation through a combination of:
> Our fleet deployment strategy currently remains weighted towards short-term fixtures, which provide us with optionality on our sizeable fleet.
> Based on current fixtures to date, our estimated TCE to date for the first quarter of 2026 on a load-to-discharge basis is presented below. Actual rates for the first quarter will vary based upon future fixtures. These estimates are based on time charter contracts entered by the Company as well as current spot fixtures on the load-to-discharge method, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the voyage from the commencement of loading to the completion of discharge. The actual TCE rates to be earned will depend on the number of contracted days and the number of ballast days at the end of the period. According to the load-to-discharge accounting method, the Company does not recognize revenue for any ballast days or uncontracted days at the end of the first quarter of 2026. At the same time, expenses for uncontracted days will be recognized as incurred.
> Our index-linked charters are listed below:
> Financial Review: 2025 Fourth Quarter
> The Company recorded net income for the fourth quarter of 2025 of $15.4 million, or $0.35 basic and diluted earnings per share. Adjusted net income of $17.3 million or basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.40 and $0.39, respectively, excluding other operating expense of $1.9 million. Comparatively, for the three months ended December 31, 2024, the Company recorded net income of $12.7 million, or $0.29 basic and diluted earnings per share. Adjusted net income amounted to $12.8 million, or $0.30 and $0.29 basic and diluted earnings per share, excluding a loss on sale of vessels of $0.2 million and unrealized fuel gains of $0.1 million.
> The Company's revenues increased to $109.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2025 as compared to $99.2 million recorded for the three months ended December 31, 2024, primarily due to higher rates earned by our minor bulk vessels, as well as the operation of a larger fleet. The average daily time charter equivalent, or TCE, rates obtained by the Company's fleet was $20,064 per day for the three months ended December 31, 2025 as compared to $18,007 per day for the three months ended December 31, 2024.
> Voyage expensesVoyage expenses decreased marginally to $31.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2025 from $31.3 million during the prior year period.
> Vessel operating expensesVessel operating expenses increased to $25.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2025 from $23.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2024. Daily vessel operating expenses, or DVOE, amounted to $6,466 per vessel per day for the fourth quarter of 2025 compared to $6,211 per vessel per day for the fourth quarter of 2024. The increase in DVOE was primarily the timing of the purchase of spares.
> We believe daily vessel operating expenses are best measured for comparative purposes over a 12-month period in order to take into account all of the expenses that each vessel in our fleet will incur over a full year of operation. Based on current estimates, our DVOE budget for Q1 2026 is $6,750 per vessel per day on a fleet-wide basis.
> General and administrative expensesGeneral and administrative expenses were $8.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2025 and the fourth quarter of 2024.
> Depreciation and amortization expensesDepreciation and amortization expenses increased to $21.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2025 from $17.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2024 primarily due to an increase in drydocking amortization expense for certain vessels in our fleet. Additionally, there was an increase in vessel depreciation expense for the Genco Courageous and Genco Intrepid, which were delivered during the fourth quarter of 2025 and the fourth quarter of 2024, respectively.
> EBITDAEBITDA for the three months ended December 31, 2025 amounted to $40.1 million compared to $32.6 million during the prior year period. During the three months of 2025 and 2024, EBITDA included other operating expenses, loss on sale of vessels, as well as gains on fuel hedges. Excluding these items, our adjusted EBITDA amounted to $42.0 million and $32.7 million, for the respective periods.
> Financial Review: Twelve Months 2025
> The Company recorded a net loss of $4.4 million or $0.10 basic and diluted net loss per share for the twelve months ended December 31, 2025. This compares to net income of $76.4 million or $1.77 and $1.75 basic and diluted earnings per share, respectively, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024.
> The Company's revenues decreased to $342.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2025 compared to $423.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, primarily due to lower rates earned by our major and minor bulk vessels, the operation of a smaller fleet and additional drydocking days during the twelve months ended December 31, 2025 as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2024. TCE rates obtained by the Company decreased to $15,502 per day for the twelve months ended December 31, 2025 from $19,107 per day for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024.
> Voyage expensesVoyage expenses decreased to $115.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2025 from $127.0 million for the same period in 2024 primarily due to lower bunker consumption on our Capesize vessels as well as lower bunker consumption during short-term time charters.
> Vessel operating expensesVessel operating expenses decreased to $98.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2025 from $101.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024. DVOE was $6,395 for the twelve months of 2025 versus $6,440 in the twelve months of 2024. The decrease in DVOE was primarily due to the timing of the purchase of stores, lower insurance costs and lower repairs and maintenance expenses, partially offset by higher crew costs and the timing of the purchase of spares.
> General and administrative expensesGeneral and administrative expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2025 increased to $30.8 million as compared to $29.1 million in the same period of 2024, primarily due to higher nonvested stock amortization expense and higher legal and professional fees.
> Depreciation and amortization expensesDepreciation and amortization expenses increased to $76.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2025 from $68.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 due to an increase in drydocking amortization expense for certain vessels in our fleet. Additionally, there was an increase in vessel depreciation expense for the Genco Intrepid and Genco Courageous which were delivered during the fourth quarter of 2024 and 2025, respectively, partially offset by a decrease in vessel depreciation for the Genco Warrior and Genco Hadrian, which were sold during the second half of 2024.
> EBITDAEBITDA for the twelve months ended December 31, 2025 amounted to $82.6 million compared to $155.4 million during the prior year period. During the twelve months of 2025 and 2024, EBITDA included non-cash impairment charges, other operating expenses, gains on sale of vessels, losses on debt extinguishment as well as gains and losses on fuel hedges. Excluding these items, our adjusted EBITDA amounted to $85.9 million and $151.2 million, for the respective periods.
> Liquidity and Capital Resources
> Net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2025 and 2024 was $31.9 million and $126.8 million, respectively.  This decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to lower rates earned by our major and minor bulk vessels, as well as changes in working capital. Additionally, there was an increase in drydocking costs incurred during 2025 as compared to 2024.
> Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities during the years ended December 31, 2025 and 2024 was ($91.6) million and $47.8 million, respectively. This fluctuation was primarily a result of $103.4 million of net proceeds from the sale of the Genco Commodus, the Genco Claudius, the Genco Maximus, the Genco Warrior and the Genco Hadrian during 2024. Additionally, there was a $35.6 million increase in the purchase of vessel assets due to the purchase of the Genco Courageous that was delivered on October 15, 2025, as well as deposits made for two Newcastlemax vessels that we agreed to purchase on November 15, 2025, as compared to the purchase of the Genco Intrepid that was delivered on October 23, 2024.
> Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities during the years ended December 31, 2025 and 2024 was $71.2 million and ($177.5) million, respectively. On July 10, 2025, the $500 Million Revolver was refinanced with the $600 Million Revolver. As part of the debt modification, $15.3 million was settled amongst the lenders of the $500 Million Revolver and $600 Million Revolver. The fluctuation is primarily due to a $130.0 million decrease in debt repayments made under our $500 Million Revolver during 2025 as compared to 2024. Additionally, during 2025, the Company made drawdowns of $100.0 million and $10.0 million on the $600 Million Revolver and the $500 Million Revolver, respectively, as compared to $20.0 million on the $500 Million Revolver during 2024. Additionally, there was a $34.7 million decrease in the payment of dividends during 2025 as compared to 2024.  These decreases were partially offset by a $5.9 million increase in the payment of deferred financing costs during 2025 related to the $600 Million Revolver.
> After the expected delivery of two Newcastlemax vessels in March 2026 that we have agreed to acquire, Genco's fleet will consist of 45 vessels with an average age of 12.7 years and an aggregate capacity of approximately 5,044,000 dwt:
> In addition to acquisitions that we may undertake, we will incur additional capital expenditures due to special surveys and drydockings. Furthermore, we plan to upgrade a portion of our fleet with energy saving devices and apply high performance paint systems to our vessels in order to reduce fuel consumption and emissions.
> We estimate our capital expenditures related to drydocking, including capitalized costs incurred during drydocking related to vessel assets and vessel equipment, ballast water treatment system costs, fuel efficiency upgrades and scheduled off-hire days for our fleet for 2026 to be:
> (1) Estimates are based on our budgeted cost of drydocking our vessels in China. Actual costs will vary based on various factors, including where the drydockings are actually performed. We expect to fund these costs with cash on hand. These costs do not include drydock expense items that are reflected in vessel operating expenses.
> (2) Estimated costs associated with the installation of ballast water treatment systems are expected to be funded with cash on hand.
> (3) Estimated costs associated with the installation of fuel efficiency upgrades are expected to be funded with cash on hand.
> (4) Actual length will vary based on the condition of the vessel, yard schedules and other factors. The estimated offhire days per sector scheduled for Q1 2026 consists of 135 days for three Capesizes, 57 days for two Ultramaxes and 46 days for two Supramaxes.
> Summary Consolidated Financial and Other Data
> The following table summarizes Genco Shipping & Trading Limited's selected consolidated financial and other data for the periods indicated below.
> 1) EBITDA represents net income (loss) attributable to Genco Shipping & Trading Limited plus net interest expense, taxes, and depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is included because it is used by management and certain investors as a measure of operating performance. EBITDA is used by analysts in the shipping industry as a common performance measure to compare results across peers. Our management uses EBITDA as a performance measure in consolidating internal financial statements and it is presented for review at our board meetings. We believe that EBITDA is useful to investors as the shipping industry is capital intensive which often results in significant depreciation and cost of financing. EBITDA presents investors with a measure in addition to net income to evaluate our performance prior to these costs. EBITDA is not an item recognized by U.S. GAAP (i.e. non-GAAP measure) and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income or any other indicator of a company's operating performance required by U.S. GAAP. EBITDA is not a measure of liquidity or cash flows as shown in our consolidated statement of cash flows. The definition of EBITDA used here may not be comparable to that used by other companies. 2) Average number of vessels is the number of vessels that constituted our fleet for the relevant period, as measured by the sum of the number of days each vessel was part of our fleet during the period divided by the number of calendar days in that period.3) We define ownership days as the aggregate number of days in a period during which each vessel in our fleet has been owned by us. Ownership days are an indicator of the size of our fleet over a period and affect both the amount of revenues and the amount of expenses that we record during a period.4) We define chartered-in days as the aggregate number of days in a period during which we chartered-in third-party vessels. 5) We define available days as the number of our ownership days and chartered-in days less the aggregate number of days that our vessels are off-hire due to familiarization upon acquisition, repairs or repairs under guarantee, vessel upgrades or special surveys. Companies in the shipping industry generally use available days to measure the number of days in a period during which vessels should be capable of generating revenues. 6) We define available days for the owned fleet as available days less chartered-in days.7) We define operating days as the number of our total available days in a period less the aggregate number of days that the vessels are off-hire due to unforeseen circumstances. The shipping industry uses operating days to measure the aggregate number of days in a period during which vessels actually generate revenues. 8) We calculate fleet utilization as the number of our operating days during a period divided by the number of ownership days plus chartered-in days less drydocking days. 9) We define TCE rates as our voyage revenues less voyage expenses, charter hire expenses, and realized gain or losses on fuel hedges, divided by the number of the available days of our owned fleet during the period-  TCE rate is not an item recognized by U.S. GAAP (i.e., it is a non-GAAP measure). However it is a common shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare daily earnings generated by vessels on time charters with daily earnings generated by vessels on voyage charters, because charterhire rates for vessels on voyage charters are generally not expressed in per-day amounts while charterhire rates for vessels on time charters generally are expressed in such amounts. Our estimated TCE for the first quarter of 2026 is based on fixtures booked to date. Actual results may vary based on the actual duration of voyages and other factors. Accordingly, we are unable to provide, without unreasonable efforts, a reconciliation of estimated TCE for the first quarter to the most comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP.
> 10) We define daily vessel operating expenses to include crew wages and related costs, the cost of insurance expenses relating to repairs and maintenance (excluding drydocking), the costs of spares and consumable stores, tonnage taxes and other miscellaneous expenses. Daily vessel operating expenses are calculated by dividing vessel operating expenses by ownership days for the relevant period.

Our ability to pay dividends in any period will depend upon various factors, including the limitations under any credit agreements to which we may be a party, applicable provisions of Marshall Islands law and the final determination by the Board of Directors each quarter after its review of our financial performance, market developments, and the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. The timing and amount of dividends, if any, could also be affected by factors affecting cash flows, results of operations, required capital expenditures, or reserves. As a result, the amount of dividends actually paid may vary. Our analysis of a potential dividend for the first quarter of 2026 is based on our fixtures to date and estimated expenses for such quarter, details of which expenses will be set forth in the appendix to our earnings presentation to be posted on our website on February 18, 2026. The exercise of the accordion feature under our revolving credit facility is subject to definitive documentation.

> TRATON GROUP and WWF Sweden Establish Strategic Partnership to Tackle Biodiversity Risks and Advance Sustainable Resource Use in Commercial Vehicles
> (IN BRIEF) TRATON GROUP and WWF Sweden have launched a three-year partnership supported by a new WWF-authored study exploring the commercial vehicle sector’s relationship with nature. The report highlights that while electrification reduces emissions, it can also create environmental challenges tied to resource extraction and material demand, urging companies to address biodiversity risks alongside climate goals. It outlines practical pathways such as sustainable sourcing, circular economy initiatives, materials innovation, and cross-value-chain collaboration to help the industry reduce environmental impact while strengthening long-term resilience.
> (PRESS RELEASE) MUNICH, 18-Feb-2026 — /EuropaWire/ — TRATON GROUP and WWF Sweden have jointly introduced a new study examining how the commercial vehicle industry both relies on and affects natural ecosystems, while also announcing a three-year partnership aimed at strengthening action on biodiversity-related challenges. The collaboration will focus on advancing TRATON’s work in responsible resource use, water stewardship, and circular business practices.
> Authored by WWF Sweden, the report, titled Looking beyond greenhouse gas emissions—Interlinkages between the commercial vehicle sector and nature, provides the analytical basis for the partnership. It outlines how environmental pressures such as biodiversity decline, limited natural resources, and climate change are creating growing operational and supply chain risks for companies throughout the sector.
> While the shift toward low-emission and electric technologies is helping reduce greenhouse gas output, the study emphasizes that this transformation can also introduce new environmental pressures. These include the extraction of raw materials, land-use changes, and pollution associated with battery production and disposal. Demand for minerals such as lithium, nickel, and rare earth elements is rising simultaneously across multiple industries, including renewable energy, intensifying cumulative strain on ecosystems and highlighting the need for coordinated, cross-industry solutions.
> The report calls for collective industry action to balance decarbonization with broader environmental responsibility and identifies several priority areas for collaboration. Among them is the adoption of more sustainable sourcing practices, including working with suppliers that meet recognized environmental and social standards. Expanding recycling systems and embedding circular economy principles are also highlighted as ways to reduce waste and environmental impact, particularly for components with large material footprints. Additionally, the study points to innovation in materials and product design as a pathway to lowering dependence on scarce resources, alongside stronger cooperation across the value chain to deliver systemic progress.
> Mats Landén, Senior Manager Corporate Partnerships at WWF Sweden, noted that nature-related risks increasingly translate into tangible business risks, making proactive environmental strategies essential for long-term resilience, stronger supply chains, and new market opportunities. Andreas Follér, Chief Sustainability Officer at TRATON GROUP, added that the collaboration has enhanced understanding of how the commercial vehicle industry interacts with natural systems and underscored the importance of leadership and industry-wide cooperation to ensure that the transition to electric mobility is carried out in a more sustainable way.
> The partnership is intended not only to guide TRATON’s own sustainability actions but also to provide insights and direction for stakeholders across the commercial vehicle ecosystem.
> The full report is now available at the following link: https://traton.com/dam/jcr:400d327f-337b-4a37-a2ea-349342143b0e/20260217_WWF-Report_Looking-beyond-greenhouse-gas-emissions.pdf
> With its brands Scania, MAN, International, and Volkswagen Truck & Bus, TRATON SE is the parent and holding company of the TRATON GROUP and one of the world’s leading commercial vehicle manufacturers. The Group’s product portfolio comprises trucks, buses, and light-duty commercial vehicles. “Transforming Transportation Together. For a sustainable world.”: this intention underlines the Company’s ambition to have a lasting and sustainable impact on the commercial vehicle business and on the Group’s commercial growth.
> WWF is the world’s largest and most experienced independent conservation organization, with over six million supporters and a global network active in more than 100 countries. WWF’s mission is to stop the degradation of the planet’s natural environment and to build a future in which humans live in harmony with nature. We will do this by conserving the world’s biological diversity, ensuring that the use of renewable natural resources is sustainable and promoting the reduction of pollution and wasteful consumption. As part of its effort to achieve this mission, WWF works in partnership with companies based on a common understanding of issues, shared ambitions or activities, and a willingness to speak out in public.
> The study is based on global, public data from the commercial vehicle industry (medium and heavy duty) that has been analyzed via WWF’s Risk Filter Suite, a tool that maps a company’s – and in this case, an entire industry’s – risk areas linked to nature. The study looks at different types of risks, such as increasing deforestation due to increased production of natural rubber and increasing commodity prices, or brands being scrutinized for their high environmental impact. Experts at WWF Sweden have created the contents for the report. The TRATON GROUP contributed input regarding the commercial vehicle sector.

## 📌 Topic: Oil Price Volatility (Geopolitical Risk, US-Iran Talks)

### 1. [Oil Falls After Iran Signals Progress in Nuclear Talks With US](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-dips-holiday-trade-focus-073425864.html)
**Source**: Yahoo Finance | **Date**: 2026-02-18T11:18:00+00:00

> (Bloomberg) -- Oil edged lower on signs that the US and Iran have made progress in nuclear talks, eroding a risk premium in benchmark futures prices.
> West Texas Intermediate fell to settle near $62 a barrel after Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said that the two countries reached a “general agreement” on the basis of a potential nuclear deal that would lift sanctions on Tehran and ease the risk of war in the Middle East. Tehran’s negotiators are scheduled to return with a new proposal in two weeks, a US official said Tuesday.

> Mamdani Threatens NYC Property Tax Hike as Last-Resort Option
> Success in the talks could pave the way for a lasting removal of a geopolitical risk premium that has kept prices elevated since the start of the year amid rising global oil supplies.
> The development erased earlier gains after Iran said it would shut parts of the Strait of Hormuz for several hours due to military drills, though traders were skeptical of a meaningful disruption to the waterway that ships about a fifth of the world’s barrels. The US has also sent a second aircraft carrier to the region.
> The two sides will each draft and exchange texts for a deal before setting a date for a third round of talks, Araghchi said, cautioning that the next stage would be “more difficult and detailed.”
> US Vice President JD Vance said Tuesday that negotiations with Iran went well but the country has not yet acknowledged President Donald Trump’s red lines.
> What Bloomberg Strategists say...
> “Agreeing on guiding principles to begin drafting text is not the same as resolving enrichment limits, inspection protocols or sequencing of sanctions relief. The market seems to understand that distinction. Implied volatility has eased from recent highs, yet spot prices remain comfortably above $60 a barrel. That resilience speaks to lingering skepticism that diplomacy will translate into anything meaningful.”

> Trend-following commodity trading advisers positioned in WTI breached several sell triggers near $62 a barrel, accelerating the price slide, according to data from Kpler’s Bridgeton Research Group. The robot traders liquidated long positions to sit at 27% short in WTI on Tuesday, compared with 45% at the start of the session, the firm said.
> Negotiations are also scheduled between Russia and Ukraine in Geneva over the next two days. However, the prospects of a speedy end to the almost four-year-old conflict and the return of Russian barrels look slim.
> Crude is up almost 10% so far this year thanks to a combination of supply disruptions, geopolitical risk and a buildup of sanctioned barrels. While futures have settled in a band between $61 and $65 for most of this month, the outcome of the flurry of diplomatic efforts in the coming days and hours could dictate the path forward for prices.

### 2. [Weeks-Long War With Iran Could Start Within Days: Bitcoin Under Pressure, But Gold, Silver, Oil Prices Surge](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/weeks-long-war-iran-could-204716334.html?fr=sycsrp_catchall)
**Source**: Yahoo Finance | **Date**: 2026-02-18T21:33:00+00:00

> Global markets are reacting sharply to rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, as reports suggest the US could be moving closer to a direct military confrontation with Iran.
> Safe-haven assets such as gold and silver are climbing, oil prices are rising on supply fears, and Bitcoin is slipping as traders rotate away from risk-sensitive assets.
> Recent intelligence and media reports indicate that any potential conflict would not be a limited strike. Rather, it would be a broader, weeks-long campaign if launched, raising concerns about prolonged volatility across commodities, equities, and crypto.
> According to Axios analysis, evidence is mounting that a conflict could be imminent, with Israel reportedly preparing for a scenario of “war within days,” which could involve a “weeks-long ‘full-fledged’ war” and a joint US–Israeli campaign broader in scope than previous operations.
> The same report noted that US forces in the region now include “2 aircraft carriers, 12 warships, hundreds of fighter jets, and multiple air defense systems.” This is in addition to more than 150 cargo flights transporting weapons and ammunition.
> Oil prices reportedly surged above $64 per barrel following the news.
> Separate commentary similarly described the US as being on the brink of a large-scale conflict, with stalled nuclear negotiations and a growing military presence increasing the risk of imminent action.
> The assessment suggested that strikes could come within weeks if diplomacy collapses, with Donald Trump's advisers continuing talks but failing to close key gaps.
> Commodity markets have been the most immediate beneficiaries of the rising geopolitical risk premium.
> Analysts tracking market moves reported that gold, silver, and oil all advanced as tensions escalated. Silver posted some of the strongest gains among major assets.
> “The precious metals sector has so far been the primary beneficiary of heightened US attack concerns,” commented commodities strategist Ole Hansen, adding that gold is trading above $5,000 while silver and platinum have also recorded significant gains.
> Oil markets are also reacting to the possibility of disruptions in the Strait of Hormuz, through which roughly one-fifth of global oil supply moves.
> Even the perception of risk to this route tends to trigger sharp price swings, amplifying volatility across energy markets.
> While traditional safe havens rallied, cryptocurrencies moved in the opposite direction. Bitcoin fell below the critical support of $67,014 and was trading for $66,384 as of this writing.
> This divergence, where Bitcoin slumps while gold, silver, and oil advance, reflects a broader risk-off shift in investor sentiment.
> The divergence highlights a recurring pattern in periods of geopolitical stress: capital often flows first into commodities and cash-like instruments before returning to higher-beta assets such as crypto.
> Despite the buildup, some analysts remain skeptical that a full-scale war will materialize. Nigerian tech entrepreneur Mark Essien argued that a prolonged conflict would be far more complex than previous campaigns.
> Based on this, Essien warns that Iran’s drone capabilities and potential insurgency could make the situation difficult to resolve quickly. Meanwhile, domestic opposition in the US is also visible.
> “Americans do not want to go to war with Iran!!! They want to be able to afford their lives and get ahead,” wrote former congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene.
> At the same time, geopolitical risks may be expanding beyond a bilateral confrontation. Reports cited by defense analysts suggest that China could be providing Iran with intelligence and navigation support, potentially complicating the regional strategic balance.
> With peace talks continuing but showing little sign of a breakthrough, markets are preparing for prolonged uncertainty. Traders are increasingly pricing in the possibility that any military action would be larger, longer, and more disruptive than recent conflicts.
> It explains why commodities are reflecting fear, cryptos are reflecting caution, and global investors are watching diplomatic developments closely.
> Whether diplomacy prevails or tensions escalate further may determine the direction of oil and gold, as well as the next major trend across global financial markets.

### 3. [Oil Prices Surge Nearly 3% After Russia-Ukraine Talks Break Down](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Oil-Prices-Surge-Nearly-3-After-Russia-Ukraine-Talks-Break-Down.html)
**Source**: OilPrice.com | **Date**: 2026-02-18T15:16:00+00:00

> Oil prices surged nearly 3% on Wednesday after peace talks between Ukraine and Russia in Geneva ended abruptly after only two hours. The failure to reach a breakthrough heightened market fears that sanctions and supply restrictions on Russian oil will persist longer than previously anticipated. Brent crude for April delivery was up 2.74% to trade at $69.15 per barrel at 8.20 am ET in Wednesday’s morning session while WTI crude for March delivery gained 2.79% to change hands at $64.05 per barrel.
> Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called the talks “difficult” and said Russia was dragging its feet rather than moving seriously toward ending the war, now in its fourth year. Before the breakdown, traders had started to factor in the possibility of a “peace dividend”, in which Russian crude could flow more freely back into global markets. When the negotiations stalled, that expectation faded, and oil prices moved higher as geopolitical risk returned to the forefront.
> Traders are also focused on Iran. U.S.-mediated nuclear talks could eventually lead to some sanctions relief and allow more Iranian crude onto the market. At the same time, joint naval drills with Russia and renewed tension around the Strait of Hormuz, through which about 20% of global oil supply passes, are keeping supply risks in view. That balance between possible additional barrels and potential disruption is adding to price swings.
> Set OilPrice.com as a preferred source in Google here.
> Meanwhile, tensions remain high following reports that Hungary has halted diesel shipments to Ukraine until crude flows through the Druzhba pipeline are fully restored. Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó announced that the cessation is a direct response to the halt of Russian oil transit through Ukraine, which has been blocked since January 27, 2026.
> Hungary has called the halt in crude shipments “political blackmail” by Ukraine and insists there is no technical reason the transit cannot restart. To secure supplies, Hungary’s MOL Group has asked to tap about 250,000 tons of strategic crude reserves and is looking at moving Russian oil through Croatia via the Adriatic pipeline. Slovakia has also warned that continued disruption could affect fuel imports and force limits on exports.
> Adding to the strain, Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovi? has voiced reservations about increasing the transit of Russian crude to Hungary through Croatia’s territory, suggesting that any expanded use of the Adriatic pipeline could face political scrutiny in Zagreb.

> Oil prices were largely unchanged in Asian trading on Wednesday after posting sharp losses in the previous session, as progress in U.S.-Iran nuclear negotiations eased concerns about potential supply disruptions. The latest developments reduced geopolitical risk premiums that had supported crude markets earlier this week.
> Brent crude futures for April delivery edged up 0.1% to $67.51 per barrel, while West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 0.1% to $62.40 per barrel. Despite the modest rebound, both benchmarks remained under pressure after Brent dropped nearly 2% and WTI fell 1% on Tuesday.
> Market sentiment shifted following reports that Washington and Tehran reached an understanding on key “guiding principles” during ongoing nuclear talks. Although Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi clarified that a final agreement is not imminent, the signs of progress raised expectations that Iranian oil exports could eventually return more fully to global markets. Iran remains a significant oil producer, and any easing of sanctions could increase global crude supply, influencing Brent and WTI prices.
> Energy traders are closely monitoring developments due to Iran’s strategic position near the Strait of Hormuz, a critical transit route handling roughly 20% of the world’s daily oil consumption. Reduced geopolitical tensions in this region typically weigh on oil prices by lowering supply risk concerns.
> Trading volumes in Asia were relatively thin due to Lunar New Year holidays across several regional markets, contributing to limited price movement.
> Investors are also awaiting key U.S. oil inventory data. The American Petroleum Institute (API) is set to release its weekly crude stock estimates, followed by official figures from the Energy Information Administration (EIA). These reports will offer insights into U.S. supply trends and short-term price direction.
> Additionally, markets are watching the Federal Reserve’s January meeting minutes and the upcoming U.S. Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation report for signals on interest rates and future fuel demand.

### 5. [Commodity wrap: oil jumps as peace talks stall; gold above $5,000](https://invezz.com/news/2026/02/18/commodity-wrap-oil-jumps-as-peace-talks-stall-gold-above-5000/)
**Source**: Invezz | **Date**: 2026-02-18T15:29:00+00:00

> Oil prices rose sharply on Wednesday as talks between Russia and Ukraine broke down abruptly, raising geopolitical tensions between the nations.
> Both crude benchmarks, West Texas Intermediate and Brent, were nearly 3% higher at the time of writing.
> Meanwhile, gold prices were back above $5,000 as investors waited for the minutes of the Federal Reserve’s last policy meeting.
> Silver prices jumped as well, with the white metal surging more than 5% to trade above $77 per ounce on COMEX.
> Following two hours of "difficult" peace talks in Geneva between Ukraine and Russia, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy confirmed had concluded, oil prices saw a nearly 3% gain on Wednesday.
> Following the conclusion of talks, Zelenskiy alleged that Russia was intentionally attempting to obstruct advancement toward an agreement to terminate the four-year-old conflict.
> The US-mediated discussions in Switzerland occurred against the backdrop of recent statements by US President Donald Trump, who twice suggested that the responsibility for ensuring the talks' success rested with Ukraine.
> Meanwhile, Hungary has halted diesel shipments to Ukraine. Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto stated on Wednesday that these shipments will not resume until Ukraine restarts the flow of crude oil via the Druzhba pipeline to Hungary.
> This development follows weeks of disruptions in Russian oil supplies flowing through Ukraine to Slovakia and Hungary, which Kyiv attributes to a Russian attack on January 27.
> Meanwhile, progress was noted in talks between the US and Iran, where both parties agreed on "guiding principles" aimed at resolving the dispute over Iran's nuclear program.
> However, Iran simultaneously employed provocative tactics, including the temporary closure of the Straits of Hormuz for military exercises.
> “It’s no secret that President Trump favours lower oil prices, and blocking the Straits for a prolonged period could lead to a sharp spike higher. It could also provoke the US into taking military action against Iran,” said David Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation.
> The price of WTI crude oil was last at $64.33 a barrel, up 3.4%, while Brent was also 3.3% higher at $69.64 a barrel.
> On Wednesday, gold prices climbed over 2%, recovering from a one-week low reached in the prior session.
> Prices rose as investors anticipated the release of the minutes from the US Federal Reserve's January meeting, expected later in the day.
> Gold experienced a brief dip on Tuesday afternoon, falling below $4,850 to reach a two-week low.
