 One of the most inconvenient things about using the MacBook Pro 2018 is that the USB port is only type-c. In the case of usb-c, it provides a fast work environment, but on the contrary, it provides inconvenience to users in terms of compatibility. Therefore, many users take various measures to solve this compatibility. In this article, I will explain my efforts to solve these problems. However, there is no correct answer to these methods, and it would be better to configure them according to your environment and taste.



## First, buy a usb hub

 In the end, the only way to fix the usb-c problem is to buy something and spend money. The most effective way among them is to buy a usb hub. In the case of usb hubs, if you search the internet, you will find many different types. Among them, I bought a USB hub that is not very expensive and can be attached to the side. At this time, if you purchase one with an HDMI port in addition to the usb 3.0 port, you can use the existing monitor at home to configure and use a dual monitor environment.

 If you purchase and use these USB hubs, you will be able to solve the compatibility problem to some extent. However, there seems to be some heat problem, so you should use it while considering it.



## Second, purchase a USB-C dedicated external hard drive

 An external hard drive is essential for MacBooks that do not have a lot of basic storage capacity. Especially in the case of MacBook, an external hard drive is essential even for backup. However, in the case of an external hard drive, careful consideration is required. In most cases, you will need to use an external hard drive on a Windows-based PC as well as on a Mac. However, depending on the disk format, some formats cannot be used in each OS, and even if they can be used, only limited capacity can be transferred. The easiest way to solve this problem is to purchase an external hard drive that can be used simultaneously with MacBook and Windows. In my case, I purchased Seagate's usb-c supported external hard drive. The advantage of this external hard drive is that it can be used without a hub and that it can take advantage of the fast transmission speed of usb-c.

 In the case of Seagate, Paragon Driver helps users to use NTFS format disks on Mac or Mac OS extended format on Windows. At this time, the choice is to decide what format to install the external hard drive in. If you set the external hard drive to the Mac OS extended format, you need to install the Paragon Driver on the PC when using it on a Windows PC. On the other hand, if you set the external hard drive to NTFS, you need to install Paragon Driver on Mac to use it. Basically, in Korea, where Windows PCs are more common than Macs, it would be better to use the latter method.

 This product is a Seagate product with a capacity of 2 terabytes that I purchased. If you purchase and use these products according to your taste, you will be able to increase the usability of your MacBook even more. In the case of this product, it has the advantage of providing not only a USB-C cable but also a USB-c to USB-3.0 cable. However, it may be slightly more expensive than products of the same capacity. However, there are limitations to this method as well. The point is that it is impossible to back up the Macbook on an NTFS formatted external hard drive even if Paragon Driver is installed. We will discuss these aspects again in the next article.
